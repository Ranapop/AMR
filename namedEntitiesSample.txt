Starbucks is not doing very well lately. Overall, while it may seem there is already a Starbucks on every corner, Starbucks still has a lot of room to grow because China is here.  They just began expansion into food products, which has been going quite well so far for them. I can attest that my own expenditure when going to Starbucks has increased, in lieu of these food products. Brazil is the world\'s #1 coffee producer, the source of about 1/3rd of the entire world\'s supply!
