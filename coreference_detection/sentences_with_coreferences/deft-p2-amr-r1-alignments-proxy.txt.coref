An Australian jury found that an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official was defamed in a book about alleged Olympic corruption in which he was depicted as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .

A New South Wales Supreme Court jury took just over 2 hours on 020201 to find Gafur Rakhimov had been libelled in a book the Great Olympic swindle which alleges Olympic corruption .

Gafur Rakhimov is an Uzbekistan Olympic boxing official and was depicted in the book as a major international heroin dealer and racketeer .

The Great Olympic swindle was written by British journalist Andrew Jennings and published by Simon and Schuster .

The Rakhimov case will now go to a single judge to hear defences and decide any damages to be awarded to Rakhimov .

The book also implied that the businessman was a gangster in the Soviet black economy and had traded sporting medals for bribes .

Rakhimov was also said to have bribed members of the International Amateur Boxing Federation in the vote for the Federation Presidency .

The 020201 verdict followed 2 defamation actions brought last year by Rakhimov against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) and Jennings and against the Sydney Morning Herald ( SMH ) and Jennings .

A jury found in the case involving the ABC that ABC 's flagship current affairs program four corners had implied Rakhimov knew some of the world 's most dangerous criminals and was suspected by the FBI of drug trafficking .

That Panel found those insinuations were not defamatory and threw out the case against the ABC and Jennings .

The jury in that case found Rakhimov had been painted as a major international criminal and had been defamed .

Suggestions that there are no longer drug lords in Afghanistan and that drug traffic into Tajikistan has been eradicated are unrealistic and false .

Tajikistan 's 780 @-@ mile border with Afghanistan is patrolled by approximately 11000 Russian soldiers under a 1992 agreement between the Russian and Tajik Governments .

South Korea 's defense ministry under attack in parliament over allegations it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for multi @-@ billion @-@ dollar fighter project .

Newspaper reports reveal that French @-@ made plane was rated higher in air force evaluations and that the Government is instead responding to political pressure from the U.S. and Boeing .

South Korea 's Defense Ministry came under attack in Parliament on 04 March 2002 over allegations that it is favoring U.S. company Boeing for a multi @-@ billion @-@ dollar fighter project .

Ruling and opposition lawmakers criticized the Ministry as newspapers reported that the French @-@ made fighter Rafale had scored the highest marks of any of the 4 contenders in field tests performed by South Korean Air Force evaluators .

The 3.2 billion U.S. dollar project to buy 40 fighters will be one of the most important international military contracts awarded this year but it has encountered multiple obstacles .

Award of the contract was temporarily suspended in February 2002 after the prices offered by 4 bidders were judged too high .

South Korea 's defense ministry promised to conclude its first @-@ stage appraisal by the end of March 2002 .

There has also been much newspaper speculation that the South Korean government might yield to U.S. pressure to buy Boeing 's aged F @-@ 15 k .

Speculation grew in February 2002 when Defense Minister Kim Dong @-@ Shin stressed that South Korea should consider security ties with the United States in the project .

Dassault is seeking its first foreign order for the Rafale .

Kang Chang @-@ Sung of the opposition Grand National Party expressed doubt of the fairness of the evaluation methods stating that his party suspects that the Defense Ministry has political reasons to select the F @-@ 15 k .

The ruling Millennium Democratic Party also accused the Ministry of favoring the F @-@ 15 k despite the defense chief 's insistence that there was no favoritism toward Boeing .

The Defense Ministry was further pressured by numerous newspaper reports of the Air Force 's evaluation of the Rafale as excellent in all categories .

Newspapers stated that the F @-@ 15 k was rated excellent in reliability and support combat capability but met only 30 percent of core technology requirements .

Newspapers stated that the Eurofighter was rated excellent in general function and reliability categories but the Rafale also earned the excellent rating for its weapons and electronic warfare capability .

Rafale reportedly offered more generous terms for technology transfer and subcontracts for South Korea 's aerospace industry .

Some analysts have stated that the study method is biased toward Boeing noting that the evaluation was revised in February 2002 to ensure that all 4 bidders would receive an automatic 60 points for technology transfer .

The Korea Herald stated that when evaluators were conducting their first @-@ stage reports the ministry ordered them to give each bidder grades within a range of 60 to 100 points instead of 0 to 100 points .

The Korea Herald stated that critics say Boeing would benefit most from the points minimum because it would gain fewer points than Dassault in terms of technology transfer and subcontracts .

Junta spokesman Colonel Hla Min stated that Myanmar became poor because of their trying to be so clean .

AFP , members of international and local press , and United Nations representatives and diplomats witnessed Myanmar destroy illicit drugs the authorities captured .

Min said Myanmar would be one of the richest countries in the region if they were as corrupt as outsiders claimed .

Min said it was enough to pay Myanmar 's national debt ten times over .

Lemahieu said that this ceremony had less processed opium and heroin than opium seeds .

It made it more symbolic and indicated the willingness of those directly involved to eliminate the opium .

It aims to prevent poppy cultivation by distributing seeds for substitution crops .

Farmers have been asked to grow seven kinds of alternative crops across 21,969 acres ( 8,891 hectares ) of land instead of opium .

Myanmar beat Afghanistan because the Taliban militia 's enforced ban on opium poppies decreased Afghan production by 90 percent .

Critics said the Myanmar regime overlooks much of the production and trafficking in drugs by ethnic insurgent groups .

Myanmar 's Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing said the success of project new destiny is evidenced by the tons of poppy seeds that have been turned in rather than seized .

Hlaing stated his confidence in the drug scourge that threatens the world will not find a place in Myanmar if the local population is committed to this sort of cooperation .

Lauk Kai is one of the regime 's showpieces for its previous crop substitution programs .

Reformed drug lord and leader of the Kokang phone Kyar Shin pledged commitment to the government program .

Ecological organization Greenpeace stated on June 21 , 2002 that Russia helped Iran to develop nuclear weapons by building Iran 's Bushehr atomic power station .

The Russian branch of Greenpeace distributed a report at a press conference of Russia 's atomic energy ministry .

Greenpeace member Vladimir Chuprov said the ministry had practically admitted that Iran will not return to Russia the spent nuclear fuel from the power station and Russia 's only use for Iran is to equip itself with nuclear weapons .

The atomic energy ministry confirmed the report 's existence and strongly denied Greenpeace 's accusations .

Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarev told AFP that Russia would only supply nuclear fuel to Iran on condition that it be returned to Russia after its use .

Shingarev said the accord on Bushehr was signed before Russia passed a law permitting the import of nuclear waste last year .

The United States and Israel fear that the Russian @-@ Iranian nuclear cooperation could enable Tehran to acquire the technology needed to build nuclear weapons .

Iran ordered the power station in 1994 at a cost of nearly 800 million dollars ( 860 million euros ) from Russia .

Iran has said the plant is being built only for civilian energy purposes and allows regular inspections of Bushehr by the International Atomic Energy Agency .

German group Siemens pulled out of the long @-@ standing project at the request of the German government after Iran 's 1979 Islamic Revolution .

Participating countries adopted tough positions in order to demonstrate commitment to eradicating the problem .

The report stated that the drug situation in Chengdu is becoming serious as drug criminals are establishing connections with criminals outside the province .

At least 36 more drug criminals have been reported executed in China in the past week to mark World Anti @-@ drugs day .

Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri adopted a strict position calling for the death sentence for drug traffickers .

The military junta of Myanmar burned narcotics it said were worth more than 1 billion U.S. dollars in its latest attempt to convince critics it is committed to eradicating their drug problem .

The junta accompanied by military pageant ignited an incinerator into which workers shoveled bags of heroin bricks and amphetamines .

Myanmar 's top ruler Senior General Than Shwe and international diplomats attended the burning ceremony in Yangon .

Myanmar anti @-@ drugs official Brigadier @-@ General Zaw Win stated in a speech before the burning that the Myanmar government is aware of the serious threat that drugs pose and considers it a national duty to do all it can to eradicate the problem .

U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officials helped conduct spot checks to verify the destruction .

Critics claim narcotics trade finances Myanmar 's military government but the Government states it is doing all it can to restrict drug trade and wants more international help to do so .

Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan reported to Princess ubolratana that the event was meant to demonstrate the Government 's strong determination to eradicate the drug problem .

Indian government tests Russian rocket amid efforts to increase defense against possible Pakistani attacks .

On 29 June 2009 Indian government test @-@ fired the multiple @-@ role Russian @-@ made rocket system known as Smerch from a missile testing range in the eastern state of Orissa .

One Ministry official stated the smart rocket has a maximum range of 90 kilometers ( 56 miles ) and is capable of striking targets in the air or on land .

Indian government has developed an array of guided and ballistic missiles and is reportedly experimenting with a maritime cruise missile that can carry nuclear warheads .

Narain also stated the Indian Defense Ministry has sought government approval to allow the Ministry to carry forward unutilized military budgetary allocations from 1 fiscal year to another .

The defense ministry has been criticized for not utilizing funds made available every year for acquisitions of latest equipment including the missile defense shield .

The Hindu newspaper stated Indian government had already acquired an early warning system to counter the threat of a missile attack by Pakistani government .

Narain stated on 28 June 2002 that Indian government had already acquired Israeli Green Pine radars that are capable of simultaneously track several in @-@ flight missiles .

The Hindustan Times daily reported that India had petitioned Israeli Government to allow the Government of New Delhi to either buy or borrow the Israeli government 's new Ofek @-@ 5 spy satellite and acquire Israel 's Arrow anti @-@ missile systems .

The Times reported that Israeli government rejected both requests and that Israeli government stated the Ofek @-@ 5 could not be moved from the satellite 's Iran @-@ Syria @-@ Iraq trajectory and the Arrow was still being developed .

Narain did not reveal names of countries India is negotiating with to acquire the missile shield .

Indian government 's attempts to upgrade systems to counter missile attacks occurs as Indian and Pakistani governments have placed about 1 million troops on India @-@ Pakistan borders since December 2001 .

In May 2001 Pakistan test @-@ fired 3 missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads .

Since independence from British rule in 1947 Indian and Pakistani governments have fought 2 of 3 wars over Kashmir .

Malaysia proposes expansion of anti @-@ terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to entire ASEAN .

The Malaysian Government proposes the expansion of an anti @-@ terrorism pact with Indonesia and the Philippines to encompass the remainder of Southeast Asia .

Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar stated that other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) will be encouraged to accede to the pact at talks next week with ASEAN foreign ministers in Brunei .

Syed Hamid stated that Thailand , Laos and Singapore had expressed interest in joining the pact .

Cooperation by poorer countries may be stymied by financial constraints and a perception that terrorism does not directly affect these countries .

An ASEAN pact is beneficial in the long @-@ term but will be difficult to implement because national security issues and interstate rivalry may make some of ASEAN 's 10 members wary to divulge information .

ASEAN must agree on a definition of terrorism to identify the common enemy .

The 3 countries share sea borders frequently used by pirates and criminals in evading pursuing troops .

The pact includes plans to trace and freeze terror funds and exchange information to curb cross @-@ border piracy , drug trafficking , illegal entry and illegal trafficking of women and children .

Indonesia and other ASEAN members must more proactively monitor terrorist activities and establish a concrete mechanism among national agencies for the protracted conflict .

20020500 ASEAN security ministers at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur failed to agree on a definition of terrorism but agreed to increase cooperation among State enforcement agencies and endorsed the use of detention without trial for suspected militants in Malaysia and Singapore .

Objections were raised concerning Malaysia 's proposal to include State terrorism in the definition .

The agreement among Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines may have been aimed at ingratiating the countries to the US rather than combating terrorism .

Officials stated that after the meeting in Brunei 20020728 @-@ 20020801 ASEAN and its major western trading partners are expected to demand freezing of terror funds and stronger counter @-@ terrorism cooperation .

Vietnam announces that all Vietnam @-@ based websites will require a license to operate in Vietnam in order to control the dissemination of reactionary or pornographic material online .

On 021015 officials stated that all Vietnam @-@ based websites will require a license to operate in Vietnam in new Vietnamese government efforts to control the dissemination of reactionary or pornographic material online .

Do Quy Doan stated to Agence France @-@ Presse that the newly @-@ imposed website licensing rule seeks to prevent harmful information from threatening Vietnamese culture and national security .

Do Quy Doan stated that the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture and Information will take 30 days to license eligible websites that do not include pornographic material , information that harms the national security or encourages violence and anti @-@ government activities .

Diplomatic , foreign and press institutions must obtain permission from the Vietnamese Foreign Affairs Ministry before applying for licenses permitting them to distribute content online in Vietnam .

Do Quy Doan stated that any Vietnam @-@ based website must clearly display the website licensing number and date on its homepage .

Writers and intellectuals in Vietnam have increasingly employed the Internet to distribute news or opinion banned from the tightly @-@ controlled Vietnamese state press .

The number of Internet users in Vietnam is rapidly increasing and could reach 5 percent of its 79 million residents by 050000 .

Most Vietnamese gain Internet access via the Vietnam 's 4,000 @-@ plus Internet cafes .

Inspectors would perform various tests , visits , and interviews and their presence alone in the country would be a deterrent .

On 18 October 2002 International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) director Mohamed ElBaradei stated it is unlikely that Iraq could conceal a nuclear weapons program if it allowed international inspectors to return .

ElBaradei stated that once inspectors were working in Iraq their presence alone would be a deterrent to developing nuclear weapons .

ElBaradei stated to reporters at his headquarters in Vienna --

ElBaradei stated that inspectors would perform environmental sampling , gamma radiation surveys from helicopters , internal periodic visits to all capable sites and interviews with all former nuclear scientists to confirm that they are not working in the nuclear program .

ElBaradei stated that the IAEA could not give a 100 percent guarantee but that the presence of inspectors would be a good deterrent and a good mechanism for detection .

It is necessary to control imports to Iraq because of the risk that Iraq is receiving nuclear material from outside the country .

There must be strong unanimous support by the UN Security Council to force Iraq to comply with IAEA inspection .

The IAEA must be given as much intelligence information as possible to guide inspectors to anything that should be inspected or to any item hidden from inspectors .

The Security Council has been meeting in open session to discuss the Iraq issue before the vote on conditions under which UN weapons inspectors will return to Baghdad to verify Iraqi assertions that it does not possess nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .

Bangladesh 's main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said 021102 that an army crackdown on crime was turning into a political witchhunt and targeting her Awami League party .

Troops were ordered into the streets more than 2 weeks ago to eliminate rampant crime but human rights groups claim fundamental rights are being trampled .

Sheikh Hasina told reporters at the airport on her return from a private trip to the United States and Europe that initially it appeared to be a neutral anti @-@ crime drive and the opposition Awami League party welcomed it .

Hasina said the crackdown is gradually turning into one to eliminate the Opposition .

Hasina wants the military to arrest real criminals and not violate Bangladesh 's constitution and human rights because of concern about such violations in the name of anti @-@ crime drive .

Sheikh Hasina said the military has to operate within the laws of the land as no one is above the law .

Police said the army hadon 021101 arrested former state minister and Awami League lawmaker talukder Abdul khaleque in southwestern Khulna city soon after he spoke at a news conference against the deployment .

Former minister and Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Sheikh Hasina 's Political Secretary ex @-@ minister Saber Hossain Chowdhury were arrested 021000 along with independent MP Hemayet Ullah aurango .

Selim , Chowdhury and aurango are being detained under the strict 740000 Special Powers Act allowing detention for 120 days without charge .

Hasina was apparently unaware of the claims of the arrest of the Jamaat leader when adding that it is an open secret that the Jamaat @-@ e @-@ Islami and the Jamaat @-@ e @-@ Islami student wing have weapons and wondering why none of the Jamaat @-@ e @-@ Islami has been arrested so far .

Zia 's administration denies the drive is politically biased and stresses that activists from ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) have also been detained .

A young BNP activist died 021101 in a hospital after being interrogated by the army .

The Russian government hailed cooperation of Arab countries in fighting terrorism and said not one Arab state backed the Chechen separatists who are accused of waging a terrorist campaign .

Yakovenko said the Russian Government finds it inadmissible to link individual States or religions with terrorism or extremism and is grateful to those Arab states which are trying to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies to cut channels for funding terrorist organizations .

The Russian government has consistently sought to portray its campaign against a separatist insurgency in Chechnya as part of the global war on terrorism and says that rebel groups are receiving backing from the terrorist Al @-@ Qaeda network and from shadowy Islamic radical groups based in countries such as Saudi Arabia .

A senior Kremlin official said last week that the Russian Government might ask the GCC State Qatar to extradite Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev .

Yandarbiyev is a former Chechen Vice @-@ President and aide to rebel president Aslan Maskhadov .

The Russian government accuses Yandarbiyev of involvement in the 041000 hostage @-@ taking in a Moscow theater .

Russian government spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Qatar 's response would demonstrate the extent of that country 's willingness to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism .

Yakovenko said that stronger ties between Russia and the GCC States could play a special role in combating international terrorism .

Ivanov said the Russian government wanted to strengthen its ties with the Gulf countries and that these ties have begun to strengthen recently .

Ivanovalso said the Russian government would like to develop them further and particularly in areas of mutual interest .

The Russian government has traditionally been close to the Arab side in the Middle East conflict and has spoken strongly against US armed intervention against Iraq in the stand @-@ off over disarmament .

Yakovenko said that Al @-@ Attiya 's talks with Russian government officials 021104 and 021105 were likely to focus on oil issues and noted that both the Russian government and the Gulf countries are interested in stable world prices .

Yakovenko said the main emphasis of the talks will be on Russia 's possible involvement in the implementation of regional projects run by the Council and said that there will be particular emphasis on finding peaceful , political and diplomatic ways to settle the Iraqi issue .

Al @-@ Attiya also plans to hold talks with economic ministers and senior officials such as the head of the Chamber of Commerce Yevgeny Primakov and the Chairman of the Russian employers ' association Arkady Volsky .

The Itar @-@ Tass news agency citing Defense Ministry sources stated that in the Franco @-@ Russian Cooperation Council meeting that much attention will be paid to the international fight against terrorism and that the Russian ministers are planning to brief the French ministers on the situation in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and on the border with neighboring Georgia .

The Itar @-@ Tass news agency stated that the Russian ministers also plan to discuss nuclear non @-@ proliferation issues and will confirm that the Russian government has not breached any international agreements in Russia 's cooperation with Iran and North Korea in the areas of nuclear technology and the sale of weapons .

The Russian and French ministers also plan to discuss the the risks of the militarization of space following the withdrawal by the United States from the 720000 Anti @-@ Ballistic Missile Treaty .

The Russian and French ministers are also expected to meet with French President Jacques Chirac to discuss the work of the Franco @-@ Russian Cooperation Council .

Tanzanian Vice President Ali Mohamed Sheni said on November 12 , 2002 that Africa needs its own health forum to create research priorities to effectively combat disease on the continent .

Tanzanian Vice President Ali Mohamed Sheni said on November 12 , 2002 that Africa needs its own health forum to create research priorities to effectively combat disease on the continent .

Sheni stated that Africa will find it difficult to influence global research priorities in its favor without a forum .

Sheni attended a four @-@ day meeting to discuss global health at Arusha in northern Tanzania .

Africa has 90 percent of the global diseases .

Sheni said the formation of the Asian and Pacific Health Research Forum and the Latin American Health Research Forum are steps in the right direction .

Feachem said the majority of the poor are getting little health research funding compared to the wealthy few .

New U.S. study claims that one @-@ tenth of Internet 's sites are blocked by the Chinese Government authorities using updated Filtering technology .

A U.S. study released on 03 December 2002 states that one @-@ tenth of the Internet 's sites may be blocked by Chinese authorities as part of efforts to prevent access to information on dissidents , Taiwan , Tibet and other subjects .

The study found that more than 50000 of the approximately 200000 websites tested were inaccessible from at least 1 point in China on at least 1 occasion .

Edelman told AFP that it is highly likely that approximately one @-@ tenth of the Internet is filtered by or recently has been filtered by China .

Edelman stated that there are many different ways to measure this effect and therefore hesitated to specify any single proportion .

The latest study was broader than prior surveys and gives perspective to disparate reports about websites that are filtered or blocked by China .

The blocked sites also included those of U.S. news organizations including ABC News and CBS News , the Alta Vista search engine , and a number of U.S. universities .

The researchers found that 100 percent of the top 10 sites with keywords Tibet , Taiwan China , or equality were blocked .

The BBC news site was consistently unavailable .

Sites for CNN , Time magazine , U.S. @-@ based public broadcasting system , the Miami Herald , and the Philadelphia Inquirer were also often blocked .

Religious sites blocked in China included the Asian American Baptist Church , The atheist network , the Catholic Civil Rights League , Feng Shui , the Jewish Federation of Winnipeg , and the Denver Zen center .

A recent report by the U.S. @-@ based Rand Corporation think tank found that the Chinese government now uses more technology to filter out objectionable content rather than relying solely on surveillance of users and seizure of equipment as it did in the past .

The rand report released earlier in 2002 found that Chinese authorities now appear to have more effective technology for filtering out undesirable content .

A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect even infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .

A laboratory chief from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said on December 10 , 2002 that the UN 's nuclear agency could detect infinitesimal amounts of radiation from weapons programs if they exist in samples from Iraq .

IAEA and other UN inspectors have been taking soil , water and air samples since November 27 , 2001 at Iraqi sites suspected of being used for programs to make weapons of mass destruction .

Donohue said it is very difficult to manipulate radioactive isotopes without leaving a trail .

South Korea urges North Korea to return nuclear reactor to UN surveillance .

North Korea had violated 1994 shut down by disabling surveillance devices .

20021222 South Korea urged North Korea to return the Yongbyon nuclear reactor to UN surveillance in order to deescalate the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula .

20021221 the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated that North Korea had disabled IAEA surveillance devices by breaking seals on IAEA equipment and blocking surveillance cameras at the country 's 5 megawatt nuclear reactor .

20021221 IAEA Director General General Mohammed ElBaradei expressed regret over North Korea 's actions .

The development is regrettable and will increase tension over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .

The IAEA stated that ElBaradei warned the government of North Korea not to take further action that would prevent the IAEA from monitoring compliance with the 1994 accord with the United States shutting down the reactor .

20041212 North Korea stated that the country 's plutonium @-@ producing nuclear program would recommence in order to produce energy due to a global embargo on oil shipments .

International experts stated that the Yongbyon reactor was used to produce weapons @-@ grade plutonium .

North Korea removed UN seals at a laboratory suspected of being used to produce weapons @-@ grade material .

The lab is suspected of having reprocessed fuel rods for weapons @-@ grade plutonium before its activities were frozen under a 940000 arms control deal with the United Sates .

The source is fully informed of IAEA activities in North Korea and said the North Koreans are cutting the seals of the nuclear fuel reprocessing laboratory and could complete it possibly by 021224 .

The move followed similar actions 021221 @-@ 021222 at the Yongbyon nuclear facility during which the North Korean government took control of 1000 s of spent fuel rods that could be used to make nuclear weapons .

The nuclear crisis dominated the first meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae @-@ Jung and President @-@ elect Roh Moo @-@ hyun earlier 021223 .

Kim and Roh were meeting for the first time since Roh 's election last week and the meeting was supposed to focus on smoothing over the 030225 transfer of power between the outgoing and incoming leaders .

President Kim 's spokeswoman Park Sun @-@ sook said that Kim and Roh 's discussion was pinned down on international relations which focused on North Korea 's nuclear issue .

The South Korean government 's frustration with the North Korean government was evident in a foreign ministry statement which urged the North Korean government to restore the seals and disabled monitoring cameras on the rods .

The statement said that the North Korean government took further actions to unfreeze its nuclear activities despite repeated warnings from the South Korean government and the international community and was raising regional tension and amplifying international concerns over nuclear proliferation .

US State Department spokesman Louis Fintor said the over 8000 spent fuel rods are of particular concern because they can be reprocessed to recover plutonium for nuclear weapons .

US Senator Richard Lugar said the North Korean government was creating a very dangerous situation , initially for South Korea and for Japan but ultimately for the United States .

Deputy US Ambassador Evans Revere met South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tai @-@ sik in Seoul on 021223 to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the North Korean government following the US and South Korean foreign ministers ' urgent talks over the phone .

The North Korean government said it unfroze its nuclear facilities because it was in a desperate energy crisis aggravated by the suspension of fuel oil shipments .

The United States and North Korea came close to war over the North Korean government 's plutonium program in the early 1990 s .

That accord has been undermined since the North Korean government admitted in 021000 to running a new , secret and separate program based on enriched uranium .

The US government cut its fuel aid to the North Korea in retaliation .

North Korea was criticized on December 26 , 2002 for moving to restart its long @-@ dormant nuclear program .

North Korea was criticized on December 26 , 2002 for moving to restart its long @-@ dormant nuclear program .

Kim Dae Jung said that North Korea moved to restart frozen nuclear facilities despite the international community 's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue .

Beginning last week IAEA saw its monitoring equipment disabled and seals removed from the nuclear facilities that had been dormant since a 1994 accord with the United States .

IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei dismissed claims by North Korea 's government that it was only acting in the wake of an energy crisis in North Korea .

ElBaradei said that the reprocessing facility at Yongbyong is irrelevant to North Korea 's ability to produce electricity .

North Korea has no current legitimate peaceful use for plutonium given the status of its nuclear fuel cycle .

ElBaradei said restarting North Korea 's nuclear facilities without appropriate safeguards and towards producing plutonium raises serious non @-@ proliferation concerns is tantamount to nuclear brinkmanship .

The move of 1,000 unspent rods into the reactor building is the latest action taken by the energy @-@ starved North since the apparent collapse of a 1994 accord that froze its nuclear capacity .

All have been stored in a cooling pond at Yongbyon since the United States offered North Korea annual supplies of heavy fuel oil and two new light water nuclear reactors in return for Pyongyang 's agreement to freeze its nuclear operations at Yongbyon .

The eight @-@ year @-@ old deal has fallen apart following US revelations in October 2002 that North Korea had admitted to running a separate nuclear program based on enriched uranium technology in violation of the accord .

North Korea is bankrupt and on the brink of economic collapse .

Experts say North Korea needs aid and security guarantees from the United States to ensure its survival .

Throughout the nuclear dispute North Korea has said it is ready to sit down and talk with the United States and even to refreeze its Yongbyon program .

President Kim has been pushing the United States to accept the offer under Kim 's sunshine policy of engagement with the North .

President Kim has criticized the United States for previously sidelining South Korea in handling North Korea and said South Korea should take a leading role .

Kim was critical of the US handling of the stand @-@ off when eight years ago the United States and North Korea drew back from the brink of war over Pyongyang 's plutonium program .

The President has complained that South Korea was sidelined during the entire dispute and ended up paying a multi @-@ billion dollar bill for the light @-@ water reactors .

Kim 's chief security adviser Yim Sung @-@ joon said the President instructed that North Korea should take lead because the North Korean nuclear issue is important to the Korean peninsula .

The United States said it would stand up to nuclear blackmail and has ruled out negotiations .

The US pledged not to reward bad behavior .

Experts have joined the IAEA in dismissing the idea that North Korea was relaunching the reactor for energy purposes .

Director General for International institutions at the ministry in Seoul Chun Young @-@ Woo said it would produce at its peak enough for one large office building which is a negligible amount .

Existing rods could produce 3 @-@ 6 atomic bombs in 6 @-@ 8 months .

Experts stated that 8000 spent fuel rods reportedly stockpiled by North Korea at a nuclear reactor the country is threatening to re @-@ start could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons .

Experts stated that the rods could produce 3 @-@ 6 atomic bombs in 6 @-@ 8 months .

The reactor could produce enough spent rods to construct 1 atomic bomb per year if reactivated .

The experimental nuclear plant in Yongbyon is a miniature of electricity @-@ producing nuclear plants in Western countries but operates on the same principles .

Fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity .

Plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3 @-@ 4 years .

Spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide .

A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said Thursday that the UK government is deeply concerned about the latest revelations in a warning by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concerning North Korea 's possible nuclear intentions .

The comments came after the IAEA accused the North Korean government of nuclear brinkmanship and said the North Korean government had begun work to reactivate the Yongbyon reactor in breach of a 940000 agreement with the United States Government .

The UK Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the UK government is in regular contact with international partners about the implications of the latest developments and is committed to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wherever it may occur .

Of more concern are the 8000 spent fuel rods at the facility they started unsealing 021215 @-@ 021221 and the dismantling of IAEA monitoring equipment at the site .

Experts say the spent rods could be used to build 3 @-@ 6 atomic bombs within 6 @-@ 8 months .

The United States Government offered supplies of fuel oil and 2 new light water nuclear reactors in return for the North Korean government 's agreement to freeze nuclear operations under the 940000 agreed framework shutting down Yongbyon .

The North Korean government in turn claimed to be in desperate need of power generation after the oil supplies were cut and began during 021215 @-@ 021221 to unseal the spent fuel rods at the facility and to dismantle monitoring equipment .

Roh has advocated a peaceful resolution to the crisis through dialogue and has criticized the US hardline policy as potentially dangerous .

20021226 incoming Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican Senator Richard Lugar stated on NBC television that a US attack would be inadvisable because North Korea would likely retaliate with a potentially devastating attack on the Seoul area .

Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer stated that Australia will suspend plans to open an embassy in Pyongyang to avoid appearing to condone North Korea 's nuclear actions .

North Korea has no use for plutonium in its civilian program and thus may be planning military activity .

Chinese scientists announced Shenzhou IV would conduct experiments on the astronaut flight system and control of Shenzhou IV 's environment and life support system .

Shenzhou IV is equipped to carry astronauts .

China plans to build a reusable space vehicle similar to the US space shuttle .

In 2001 Russia signed a 5 @-@ year space cooperation agreement with China .

The agreement stipulates that Russia provide China with manned space craft technologies and train Chinese astronauts in Russian facilities .

In May 2002 official Chinese media announced that China plans to establish a base on the moon to exploit the Moon 's mineral resources .

Some US researchers believe China is developing weaponization of its space technology .

China may be developing weaponization of its space technology but is not currently able to implement it .

China plans to put humans in space for prestige .

Shenzhou III 's carrier rocket was equipped with a fault @-@ detecting and handling system .

Shenzhou IV is backed by a ground @-@ based search and rescue system and reinforced by other more reliable safety measures than Shenzhou III 's .

The functions , indices and data relevant to manned flights tested well on three previous successful launches and landings of Shenzhou spaceships between 1999 and March 2002 .

Shenzhou I launched in November 1999 and returned to earth within one day .

The re @-@ entry vehicle successfully returned to Inner Mongolia a week later .

Shenzhou IV is also referred to as Divine Vessel IV .

European Space Agency is finalizing deal with Russian government to allow for Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , in French Guiana replacing phased @-@ out Ariane @-@ 4 launchers .

Plans for Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since costly modifications to launch facilities must be made to accommodate the Russian rocket .

The European Space Agency ( ESA ) stated 10 January 2003 that it was finalizing a deal with the Russian government that could allow Soyuz rockets to be launched from Europe 's space command at Kourou , French Guiana .

The deal between the ESA and the Russian Government could be written as early as March 2003 and signed by the Russian government in April 2003 .

Spacecraft launched from Kourou benefit from the Earth 's full rotational speed on the equator to aid their trajectory into space .

Plans for the Soyuz launches have been delayed by funding issues since modifications to be made to launch facilities in order to accommodate the Russian rocket are predicted to cost between 250 and 300 million euro .

The Russian space program has experienced funding problems and was unwilling to contribute one third of the bill as ESA had requested .

In November 2002 the Government of France proposed to fund the Russian Government 's share with a loan to be paid back by profits from the launches .

France joined Russia in creating a joint company Starsem in 1996 to commercialize and market the Soyuz launches from Russia 's Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan .

Prime Minister Koizumi meets with President Putin to demand that North Korea reverse NPT withdrawal .

Japan demands that North Korea annul the 20030110 decision to withdraw from the nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .

Japan will collaborate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and countries including Russia to ensure North Korea 's reversal .

Koizumi condemns and is concerned by North Korea 's decision .

Koizumi stated that Russia , Japan , and the international community would benefit from improved bilateral relations if Russia and Japan could overcome previous disputes .

Japan will continue to assist Russia in dismantling weapons of mass destruction including decommissioned nuclear submarines for which Japan will allocate over 200 million dollars .

Japan has contributed 56 million dollars to scientific projects and will continue to cooperate with Russia .

Russia has previously refused to pressure North Korea over defense policy .

Koizumi will visit the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk late 20030111 and return to Tokyo 20030112 .

An Indian information technology expert disproved the phobia of cyber attacks and said the threat was overstated .

An Indian information technology expert disproved the phobia of cyber attacks and said the threat was overstated .

Director of the Indian Institute of Information Technology S. Sadagopan said the cyber attack is similar to the Y2K myth ; although these things could happen , they will not happen .

Y2K was a computer malfunction expected to occur when 1999 changed to 2000 but it did not inflict widespread damage .

Sadagopan said the G8 nations have lost 43 billion dollars due to cyber crime .

The G8 nations are comprised of France , Britain , Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the United States .

Sadagopan stated that many sensitive installations such as nuclear and power plants , and missiles have an Internet protocol address and that once someone hacks into the sites one can trip the power lines or lead planes and missiles to their choice destinations .

Sadagopan added that this type of hacking is possible , but there is no need to panic .

Sadagopan said it needs to be recognized and while we should be sensitive about such threats it should not be sensationalized rather a pragmatic approach should be taken .

The U.S. State Department said in May 2002 that a computer Hacker had infiltrated its e @-@ mail system .

Sadagopan said the threat is overstated and that it is like any other threat , like a foreigner driving on Bangalore roads .

Pakistan authorities announce upgrades of security of nuclear facilities and employees after press reports alleging leaks of its its nuclear technology .

The Los Angeles Times , New York Times and Japanese media have carried several reports quoting unnamed US officials saying that Pakistani scientists or military officers had sold the North Korean government uranium @-@ enrichment technology for the nuclear program .

Pakistan 's government has angrily rejected the reports as malicious and insisted that nuclear technology had never been sold or leaked .

The military statement said Pakistan 's has a long @-@ standing capability for achieving the highest levels of safety and security which is adequate and fail @-@ safe .

The Pakistani government 's announcement came after President Pervez Musharraf chaired a meeting of the Development Control Committee of the National Command Authority ( NCA ) to review security of Pakistan 's nuclear program .

An official military statement said the physical protection and custodial controls at Pakistan 's nuclear sites and facilities has been recently upgraded .

2 Pakistani nuclear scientists were arrested 12 months ago and interrogated by US Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of possible cooperation with the Taliban .

Pakistan 's government has been developing a nuclear program to match arch @-@ rival India 's since the 1970 s and only went public with the program in 980500 when testing 5 nuclear devices .

Jane 's Defence Weekly estimates that Pakistan 's government possesses 25 @-@ 50 nuclear warheads and has a uranium enrichment plant and plutonium reprocessing plant close to the capital Islamabad and at least 4 nuclear reactors across the country .

Pakistan 's NCA also decided on 030122 not to respond to India 's 3 missile tests this month and stated that Pakistan 's government has no desire to increase tension in the region .

Protestors chanted that India should release Syed Ali Geelani and other Kashmiri leaders and that Indian aggressors should leave Kashmir .

Geelani was charged with aiding and abetting terrorist activities and funding terrorist organizations in the Kashmir state .

The dispute over Kashmir caused 2 of the 3 wars between India and Pakistan since India and Pakistan 's independence from Britain in 1947 .

India has been detaining Kashmiris to suppress Pakistan 's freedom movement .

Pakistan 's armed forces should advance in Kashmir to liberate its territory under Indian occupation .

Protesters burned an effigy of US President George W. Bush before dispersing .

Vice President of macafee avert labs and leader of network associates ' antivirus response team Vincent gulloto stated that by late 20030125 the worm affected nearly 250000 computers worldwide .

Traffic control sites worldwide registered decelerated email and other transmissions at at 0530 GMT on 20030125 but the private Internet @-@ monitoring and network protection advising group cert and the national infrastructure Protection Center stated that activity normalized by 1500 GMT .

Traffic remained slow for South Korean Internet users 20030126 .

Computer experts in China and Taiwan stated that clients have reported major networking problems .

20030126 South Korean information and communication minister Lee Sang @-@ Chul held emergency talks with State and private network experts and apologized for the Internet breakdown .

Both the public and firms are required to follow the Ministry 's guidelines .

Security experts stated that hackers could have implemented the slammer attack on the weekend in order to gauge damage in advance of launching a more devastating attack .

Unlike viruses , worms do not require a user to initiate a command such as opening an email attachment to infect the computer .

Worms carry a self @-@ regenerating mechanism that enables them to multiply rapidly across the web and triggers the flow of copious transmissions into computer systems .

The official at the ministry 's nuclear safeguard office said that the case had been reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) of the United Nations .

The official added that another 29 kg disintegrated into another type of element .

The official said that plutonium may have been stuck to fuel tubes or mixed with waste water being processed to be solidified in glass and disposed of .

The official said that there was a need for improvements in measuring and evaluating methods of plutonium .

3 workers set off a critical reaction in 990000 when they poured too much uranium into a precipitation tank .

On 030128 Italy 's Internet network was hit by most serious Internet attack to date that severely disrupted Italy 's post offices .

Officials stated that on 030128 Italy 's Internet network was hit by most serious Internet attack to date that severely disrupted Italy 's post offices .

A computer security expert named Fulvio berghella stated that the 030128 attack on Italy 's Internet network were the result of a digital worm named sq hell and that the attack was the worst Internet attack ever to hit Italy .

Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell was particularly virulent and replicated itself at the rate of 8000 times an hour .

Fulvio berghella stated that the digital worm named sq hell has a very high capacity to replicate itself and the digital worm named sq Hell is slowing down the Poste italiane computer network and making some computers inoperable .

A computer worm is unlike a computer virus and does not require a user to open an e @-@ mail attachment or initiate any other type of command to infect the computer .

Italian consumers were unable to use Poste italiane 's cash machines or pay utility bills online .

In 000000 Italy was attacked by a strike similar to the 030128 attack on Italy 's Internet network and at least 8 other Internet attacks in 020000 .

Indian Deputy PM identifies Southeast Asia as a new center for jihadi terrorism and urges closer international counter @-@ terrorism cooperation following bombing in Bali .

20030204 Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani stated at a public lecture in Singapore addressing academics , diplomats and business executives that Southeast Asia was becoming an operational center of terrorism and Governments must cooperate more closely to combat terrorism .

The attack is considered part of a global incitement to Jihad by al @-@ Qaeda and its allies .

India previously knew that the operational center of jihadi terrorism is located near India due to the US @-@ lead bombing campaign against extremist bases in Afghanistan .

Countries must continue in pursuing enhanced cooperation including intelligence sharing and border controls to combat the problem perpetrated by global terrorism and its concomitants -- drug trafficking , illegal arms trade and cross @-@ border crime .

While the international consensus is that terrorism cannot be tolerated , the instruments the international community proposes to deal with terrorism do not meet the requirements of the problem .

Countries must formulate and implement an integrated and cooperative approach to security by designing new security systems to protecting transport , communication and energy infrastructure from terrorist attack as well as obstructing terrorists ' funding .

Unilateral military action such as the standoff between the US and Iraq on disarming Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatens peace and could lead to unforeseen negative consequences .

Advani visited Singapore 20030202 @-@ 20030205 .

The people alleged to have produced anti @-@ government materials included a National League for Democracy Vice Chairman from Kamayut township named Khin Win and Shan National League for Democracy 's Secretary Sai Nyunt Lwin .

Than Tun stated Maung Maung Myint was arrested on 030210 together with around 450 anti @-@ government pamphlets that Maung Maung Myint admitted he had personally authored .

Than Tun stated Maung Maung Myint had also admitted to authoring an anti @-@ government pamphlet targeting monks and students and that 1000 copies of these pantalets had been produced for public distribution .

Than Tun stated the pro @-@ democracy activist were obviously trying to get the sympathy of monks as well as the general public for the pro @-@ democracy cause .

Than Tun stated that Myanmar 's military will take legal action against some of the 12 arrested activists and release those Myanmar 's military deem to be innocent after the investigation is complete .

Than Tun stated that international human rights group such as Amnesty International do not need to be concerned about illegal prosecution of the 12 arrested activist .

Amnesty International returned last week from Amnesty International 's first fact @-@ finding mission to Myanmar .

Myanmar is widely criticised for Myanmar 's poor human rights record .

In a 030210 briefing in Bangkok regarding Amnesty International 's first visit to Myanmar , Amnesty International called for the release of all political prisoners and pressured Myanmar 's government to improve Myanmar 's human rights record .

Amnesty International stated that Myanmar 's authorities had in no way hindered Amnesty International 's fact @-@ finding mission .

Than Tun stated that despite the fact that it was clear some members of the opposition parties were involved in anti @-@ Government activities Myanmar 's military have not accused the leadership of the National League for Democracy or the Shan National League for Democracy of being directly involved .

Than Tun stated that it remains to be seen whether the opposition parties involved will take disciplinary action or act in the defense of the 12 arrested activist .

A team of South African weapons experts departs for Iraq with UN approval to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .

Political tensions are increasing as the U.S. threatens war against Iraq .

South African President Thabo Mbeki stated on 18 February 2003 that a South African team of weapons experts will depart to Iraq within days to assist with Iraq 's disarmament program .

In an address to parliament in Cape Town Mbeki stated --

The weapons experts will be able to address all matters that relate to nuclear , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction , missile systems , non @-@ proliferation and disarmament .

Mbeki stated in his State of the Nation Address on 14 February 2003 that Iraq had accepted an offer from South Africa to send a team of weapons experts to assist Iraqi government officials , scientists and engineers with its disarmament program .

South Africa dismantled a number of nuclear weapons 10 years ago and was recently praised for its model cooperation with weapons experts invited to inspect its sites .

Pahad stated that the group of South African experts will be able to assist the Iraqis by relating its experience .

The team of seven experts comprises Deon Smit , Ben Steyn , Phillip Coleman , super moloi , Daan van beeck , Peter Goosen and Tom Markram .

The team would visit Iraq in a consulting role and would not replace UN weapons inspectors .

In 2002 Basson was acquitted in a South African court on all 46 charges filed against him including murder , fraud and drug dealing .

Basson 's trial related to his work as head of Project Coast .

Van beek is the director of non @-@ proliferation and space in the Trade and Industry Department .

Van beek also heads the secretariat for the Council for the non @-@ proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which oversees South Africa 's non @-@ proliferation legislation .

Mbeki expressed confidence that the South African team of experts would contribute greatly to Iraq 's efforts to meet obligations imposed by the UN Security Council .

The Government of South Africa 's proposal to assist the Iraqi government was discussed with UN Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq .

This week the UN Security Council is debating U.S. threats to lead a war on Iraq after chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix delivered a progress report to the body on 14 February 2003 .

South Africa 's ambassador to the United Nations Dumisani Khumalo has been calling for public sessions of the Security Council instead of closed meetings in order to allow other countries to participate in discussions .

South Africa is the chair of both the African Union and Non @-@ Aligned Movement and has been vocal in its opposition to an attack on Iraq .

South Africa states that the UN Security Council is the only body fit to deal with the matter .

In February 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former President Nelson Mandela stated that U.S. President George W. Bush lacked foresight , could not think properly , and would cause a world holocaust if the U.S. continued with plans to wage war against Iraq .

Critics have stated that despite the dire effects an Iraqi conflict would have on the African continent South Africa needed to carefully assess balancing its economic relations with the United States with its serious opposition to a U.S. @-@ led war .

In his speech before parliament 14 February 2003 Mbeki referred to this criticism as most unfortunate stating --

The South African government maintains very good relations with the United States Government .

Differences on any issue have never pressured the South African Government into submitting to the United States ' views .

Iranian opposition group accused Iran of building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program with goal of altering power balance in region .

UN nuclear inspectors to depart for Iran to conduct inspections of 2 sites .

On 20 February 2003 Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) stated that Iran was building banned uranium enrichment sites as part of a nuclear weapons program .

The statement was made on the evening preceding a UN team 's departure for Iran to conduct inspections at 2 nuclear sites .

U.S. Representative for NCRI soona samsami stated at a press conference in Washington D.C. that Iran 's strategy is to build weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons in particular in order to alter the balance of power in the region in its favor and to facilitate export of fundamentalism and terrorism .

UN International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and its director Mohamed ElBaradei depart for Iran 21 February 2003 to conduct an inspection at a site in Natanz where representatives of the NCRI have stated that the regime has concealed a test centrifuge .

NCRI showed satellite photographs of a site in Natanz portraying a cluster of warehouses in which the group claims the regime has hidden centrifuges used to enrich uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons .

Samsami stated that the clerical regime is taking advantage of the current crisis in the region and has accelerated its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons .

On 09 February 2003 Iranian President Mohammed Khatami recognized the existence of a uranium mine and extraction center but promised that the uranium would be used only for peaceful purposes .

The U.S. government was skeptical of Iran 's intentions and stated that Iran 's pursuit of a complete fuel cycle only made sense if it were pursuing nuclear weapons .

NCRI stated on 20 February 2003 that Iran 's clerical rulers are also building and have tested missiles that would eventually have a range of 4000 to 6000 kilometers ( 2500 to 3700 miles ) .

NCRI stated that the information on Iran 's weapons program had been supplied through their intelligence network within Iran and that satellite photographs were supplied by the Institute for Science and International Security .

The Iranian government intended to bar IAEA entry to 1 of the 5 large buildings where the centrifuge is located and would claim that it is a warehouse similar to the other 4 .

ElBaradei planned to conduct inspections at the Natanz facility south of Tehran and at the Arak site southwest of Tehran on 22 February 2003 and 23 February 2003 .

Samsami stated that Iran 's clerical regime is in a tenuous position facing unprecedented social disenchantment and expansion of popular resistance and would therefore not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction to stabilize its position .

The Government of Iran revealed earlier this month that it had discovered uranium deposits near the central city of Yazd and that a uranium oxide plant had been completed in the central city of Isfahan and would be complemented by an enrichment plant now under construction near Kashan to its north .

The United Nations organ said there continues to be indications that manufacturers of heroin are increasingly shifting their attention to methamphetamine particularly in Myanmar .

The UN organ stated that more than 70 percent of all the seizures in amphetamines made in the world took place in East and Southeast Asia , mainly China and Thailand .

The region remains the second largest source of opium and heroin in the world behind Afghanistan .

The Board told Indonesia , Myanmar and the Philippines to enforce without delaying laws passed over the last couple of years in the three countries .

This referred to an issue closely related to the illicit drugs trade , namely money @-@ laundering and was to combat the practice .

The Board voiced concern that Cambodia and North Korea have yet to become parties to any of the international drug control treaties .

Kashmiri militant groups claim responsibility for attack on Indian police post in the disputed region that killed at least 11 people .

On 16 March 2003 Kashmiri militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a police post in the disputed state of Kashmir in India stating that they attacked to avenge the killing of their commanders by Indian troops .

A spokesman for Hizbul Mujahideen who declined to be identified stated to AFP --

The attack was in retaliation to the recent killing of district commander Amanullah and 3 other fighters of Hizbul Mujahideen by the Indian army in Kashmir .

Approximately 10 to 15 fighters from Hizbul Mujahideen , Harkatul Mujahideen , Harkatul Jihad @-@ e @-@ Islami and Al Badar attacked the camp before midnight on 15 March 2003 and into 16 March 2003 and killed at least 12 soldiers .

All the fighters who participated in the operation were local Kashmiris not infiltrators from Pakistan as claimed by Indian officials .

The Indian claim that cross @-@ border incursions have increased is baseless and aimed at covering up its failures in occupied Kashmir .

A spokesman for another Kashmiri separatist group called Harkatul Mujahideen agreed with the Hizbul official stating --

If India blames foreign militants it is part of its propaganda to mislead the international community .

The Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan and is claimed by both .

India and Pakistan have fought 2 wars over Kashmir since each gained independence from Britain in 1947 .

India accuses Pakistan of funding and training rebels fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir .

Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .

On March 21 , 2003 a spokesman for the Central Asian country 's defense ministry said Kazakhstan increased its air defenses to prevent any missiles fired during the Iraq war from threatening its Caspian coast .

Kazakhstan 's increased air defenses come during Kazakhstan 's air force carries out exercises along its Caspian shores .

Western countries said it is inadequately defended in the event of terrorist attack .

Investors could turn their attention to Iraq 's vast oil resources instead .

Pierre @-@ Arnaud chouvy and Joel meissonnier state in their book Yaa BAA recently published by the Institute of Research on contemporary Southeast Asia that the psychotropic drugs is used across society for both work and pleasure .

Construction workers , sailors , farmers and taxi drivers take the drug to help them through long working days .

Students use it to get through exam periods .

Clubbers use it to help them dance all night .

Yaa BAA possesses several qualities that have helped it supplant heroin as the drug of choice in Thailand .

It appears modern and inoffensive because it is synthetic .

They can be popped or dissolved in a glass of water , taken intravenously , pulverized and inhaled , or smoked .

Yaa BAA is easy to manufacture and do not have any climate uncertainties like other drugs have .

Heroin requires opium poppy as its raw ingredient and cocaine depends on yields from the coca plant .

It cost 60 baht ( 1.50 dollars ) per pill on the streets before Thailand 's drug war started on February 1 , 2003 and push the price up 300 percent .

Myanmar could become an unrivaled regional producer because of the links between the military rulers and the UWSA , and the jungle canopy where UWSA operate .

Chouvy and meissonnier say that methamphetamine is overtaking heroin as the production drug of choice in the area and is profiting enormously from the distribution networks that heroin trafficking has already established .

It was first used in the 1920 s as an antidepressant and then as a psychostimulant during World War II and the Vietnam War .

Myanmar soldiers and Thai police and bureaucrats protect the cargo and allow them to eventually reach consumers in Thailand .

The retailer will usually sell more to the drug user than he or she requires .

This creates another dealer and explains the drug 's easy availability across Thailand .

Owners of boats in the southern coastal province of Ranong and construction foremen in Bangkok are known to force their workers to take the drug at the beginning of the workday .

Occasionally in rural areas the farmers dissolve the drug in a bottle which they drink while working .

Afghanistan 's Interior Minister states that Taliban is not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite post @-@ winter increase in attacks on government and foreign targets in the country .

Most of the attacks are carried out by Pakistan @-@ based former Taliban members sent into Afghanistan and funded by drug smuggling operations or supporters in Pakistan .

On 03 April 2003 Afghanistan 's Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali stated that Taliban and remaining al @-@ Qaeda militants are not capable of destabilizing the Afghan government despite their increased attacks on government and foreign targets .

Jalali was speaking at his first press conference since taking office in February 2003 .

Jalali stated that due to the warmer spring weather terrorist activities have increased particularly in the south and southeast regions of Afghanistan .

On 02 April 2003 the U.S. State Department stated that security in Afghanistan was volatile and unpredictable following a series of attacks against foreigners .

In a travel advisory the U.S. State Department stated that travel in all areas of Afghanistan including the capital Kabul is unsafe due to military operations , land mines , banditry , armed rivalry among political and tribal groups , and the possibility of terrorist attacks including attacks using vehicular or other bombs .

Last week a foreign Red Cross worker was murdered and 2 U.S. special forces were killed in an ambush while on patrol .

On 03 April 2003 Afghan militia forces were fighting Taliban extremists for the 3 rd day near Spin Boldak in southern Kandahar province near the Pakistani border .

There are approximately 50 @-@ 60 terrorists in the mountains of the southern Kandahar province and the Kandahar security forces are conducting operations against them .

On 02 April 2003 2 members of the security forces were killed and 1 was wounded .

Jalali stated that among the former Taliban members arrested were several well @-@ known former Taliban figures who were in Afghanistan to establish a network of terrorist organizations and to conduct anti @-@ government activities in the area .

Approximately 15 suspected Taliban members were captured in Kandahar and 9 killed in operations launched after the 27 March 2003 murder of the Red Cross worker .

These members have confessed that they were sent from Pakistan into Afghanistan by the former Taliban leader .

The Pakistan @-@ based former Taliban members conducting the attacks were being funded by former drug smuggling operations or by supporters in Pakistan .

The militants coming across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan are organized by former Taliban elements .

Funds are transferred to the Pakistan @-@ based former Taliban members from Karachi , Quetta and Peshawar but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting the former Taliban .

It is true that the interrogated Afghan Taliban stated that they had come from Pakistan and received their financial support from Karachi and Quetta but this does not indicate that the Government of Pakistan is supporting them .

On 030406 Pakistani officials stated that Pakistan 's army @-@ led Anti Narcotics Force seized 1.22 metric tons of opium after a gun battle with drug smugglers in the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan .

Pakistani officials stated that the gun battle took place in the Kharan desert on the Iranian border 212 miles west of the Baluchistan province capital of Quetta late on 030404 .

An Anti Narcotics Force official stated that Anti Narcotics Force agents spotted a vehicle during a routine night patrol of the area west of Quetta along the Pakistan @-@ Iran border , an ANF official said .

An Anti Narcotics Force official stated that when the Anti Narcotics Force motioned the vehicle to stop the vehicle 's occupants opened fire and that the firefight lasted half an hour .

The Anti Narcotics Force official stated that the Anti Narcotics Force team recovered 1.22 metric tons of opium from the vehicle after an exchange of gun fire and arrested the vehicle 's driver .

The Anti Narcotics Force official stated that the drug smugglers managed to escape under the cover of darkness and that the Anti Narcotics Force team recovered three rifles , a machine gun , rocket launcher , two grenades and hundreds of rounds of ammunition from the vehicle .

A purported Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri recording called for more suicide attacks , highlighting again the role of Egyptians in al @-@ Qaeda , while suspicions grow that another Egyptian , Seif al @-@ Adel , may have been behind the bombings in Saudi Arabia .

In a message aired 030521 by Arabic Qatar 's Al @-@ Jazeera satellite channel , the purported voice of Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri urged Muslims to force Westerners out of Muslim lands by attacking westerners and emulating the 010911 suicide attacks in the United States .

The speaker called for Muslims to muster their resolve and hit the embassies of America , England , Australia and Norway , and strike at the interests , companies and employees of America , England , Australia and Norway .

The speaker urged Muslims to attack and eject Americans , British , Australians and Norwegians out of Muslim homelands .

The speaker told Muslims not to allow Americans , British , Australians , Norwegians or other Western Christians to live in and benefit from the resources of Muslim countries .

Egyptian experts said this audiotape was a genuine recording of Zawahiri 's voice and proved Zawahiri was alive and still as influential as before in al @-@ Qaeda .

Montasser al @-@ Zayat , a lawyer who has represented Islamic militant suspects in Egypt , stated he was certain that the voice on the tape was that of Zawahiri , Al @-@ Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's top lieutenant .

Dia al @-@ Rashwan stated that he believed that the voice was Zawahiri 's and that the message bore Zawahiri 's characteristic emphasis on Islamic militant attacks against Arab governments which are allied to the United States .

Rashwan thought it was clear that Zawahiri is still second in command of al @-@ Qaeda and that his stress on local ( Arab ) targets was influencing not only statements and actions by Al @-@ Qaeda itself but also groups inspired by them .

Montasser al @-@ Zayat said that he believed bin Laden was under secure protection with Zawahiri .

The situations and locations of Zawahiri , bin Laden and other top al @-@ Qaeda members have been unknown since the United States struck the bases of al @-@ Qaeda and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan in 011000 .

Rashwan was unable to illuminate suspicions that Seif al @-@ Adel , another Egyptian , might have masterminded the triple suicide bombings that killed 34 people , including 9 bombers , in Riyadh , Suadi Arabia 030512 .

Rashwan and other Egyptian experts said that Adel has become Al @-@ Qaeda 's number 3 in command since becoming chief of military operations and succeeding Abu Hafs al @-@ Masri .

Al @-@ Jihad was led by Zawahiri and carried out many attacks in Egypt in the 1990 s .

Adel left Egypt at the end of the 1980 s for a Gulf Arab country , then traveled to Pakistan and then Afghanistan , where he helped train militants at some camps , Egyptian sources said on condition they not be named .

A senior Saudi official said 030519 that he believed Adel directed the bombings in Riyadh .

At least three other Egyptians were also on the list : Tharwat Salah Shehata , Tariq Anwar As @-@ Sayyid Ahmad and Mohammad Salah .

Egyptian security sources said that Ahmad and Salah were killed in the war on terror launched after 010911 .

Ahmad and Salah were believed to have organized suicide attacks .

Indian troops already fighting rebels in Kashmir are now engaged in a massive campaign to destroy poppy crops in the region .

Troops are facing angry farmers unaware that poppy cultivation is now punishable as a drug trafficking offense .

Indian troops already fighting rebels are now also engaged in a massive operation to destroy poppy crops in Kashmir .

Customs officials from the Federal Finance Ministry launched the campaign with security forces on 15 May 2003 in the southern Kashmir already affected by much violence .

The campaign requires troops to confront angry residents desperate to earn a living and unaware they are violating the law .

A similar drive was carried out in 2002 in the same region but did not stop residents from replanting .

No district official has ever taken steps to destroy the crop nor even reported that poppy crops are grown in his area .

Villagers in this region approximately 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) south of Kashmir 's summer capital Srinagar stated that cultivating poppy crops was their only livelihood .

Farmer Ghulam Ahmed stated that he and other farmers have been growing poppy crops in their fields for years with no objection from anyone .

Ahmed stated that residents were shocked when officials and troops started destroying their harvest .

Many villagers grow poppy for their seeds used to flavor the Kashmiri bread known as kulcha .

Bakers buy the seeds at 100 rupees ( two U.S. dollars ) per kilogram .

Rahti Begum was disconsolate as she watched her crop being destroyed .

Begum who raises the 3 children of her late son stated that her poppy crop is her only source of income .

They cultivate the crop for poppy seeds unaware that its cultivation is punishable .

The villagers are inadvertently involving themselves in drug trafficking .

Officials state that because many farmers are unaware of these laws security forces make no arrests over poppy cultivation .

If the cultivation continues unrestrained Kashmir may soon become notorious for narcotics .

This has potential serious consequences as Kashmiri youth may become addicted to narcotics grown in the region .

Poppy cultivation at present is largely organized by groups who use their own trucks to transport the drugs for sale in other parts of India .

Federal and state officials and non @-@ governmental organizations should cooperate on the anti @-@ drug campaign and could end the poppy trade in Kashmir .

Kim Myong @-@ Chol warned that if there was an interdiction of North Korean vessels the North Korean government would retaliate with a nuclear missile attack on major cities such as New York and Washington .

Kim Myong @-@ Chol warned that if Australia took part in interdicting North Korean vessels that Australia could also be attacked .

Kim Myong @-@ Chol stated that the official North Korean position is , if Australia becomes part of American manipulation against North Korea then North Korea reserves the right to attack Australia .

Kim Myong @-@ Chol stated that Australia lacks the capacity to reach North Korea .

Alexander Downer stated that the maritime force proposed to stop trafficking in illicit weapons and drugs would operate within the frame of international law and it did not appear at this stage that any changes would be needed to strengthen international law to allow the operation to procede .

Kim Myong @-@ Chol warned astralian Prime Minister John Howard to carefully consider his approach to the North Korean issue .

Kim Myong @-@ Chol stated that the North Korean message is for Australia to watch what they say or Australia will be harmed .

North Korea has boasted of nuclear ambitions and North Korea is now reported to have missiles trained on Japan .

Chinese deputy foreign minister was dispatched to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong @-@ Il in an attempt to deescalate the situation .

Chinese diplomats were quoted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on 18 July 2003 as stating that China believes North Korea currently has enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb .

This belief caused the Government of China to accelerate diplomacy to resolve the crisis and to dispatch Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo to Pyongyang , North Korea on 12 July 2003 in this effort .

Dai is presently in Washington D.C. to inform top U.S. policymakers of the outcome of the rare meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong @-@ Il .

The newspaper stated that in recent weeks Chinese intelligence services concluded that North Korea is producing weapons @-@ grade plutonium in sufficient quantities and possesses all the necessary components to assemble nuclear @-@ tipped missiles .

A European official familiar with internal Chinese reports on the findings and Chinese diplomats were quoted in the newspaper as stating that the reprocessed plutonium is estimated to be sufficient to make at least 1 nuclear device .

The European official stated that North Korea has yet to combine the plutonium , triggering devices and other components into a bomb .

The Chinese reports in part verify recent claims made by the Government of North Korea that a number of spent nuclear fuel rods sealed in 1994 have been opened and have undergone reprocessing ostensibly to produce plutonium .

U.S. and South Korean officials have speculated that North Korea may have 1 or 2 nuclear bombs and may have the capacity to build 6 .

The Chinese government 's increasing concern was made evident by the new urgency of its diplomacy this week .

Kong Quan stated that China is attempting to deescalate the situation by promoting talks and encouraging the 2 parties to make peace .

Kong Quan stated that it is important that the parties return to negotiations and continue with the trilateral talks that commenced in April 2003 .

The trilateral talks of April ended poorly with the North Korean government stating it possessed and might test nuclear weapons .

According to U.S. officials there is now a greater possibility that new talks could occur as North Korea appears willing to join another negotiating session with China and the United States .

There were also indications that the dialogue could be expanded to include Japan and South Korea .

The United States government has always insisted on multilateral talks and has been eager to include its Japanese and South Korean allies .

North Korea has consistently demanded 1 @-@ on @-@ 1 talks with the U.S. government .

China is a traditional ally and supplier of food and fuel to North Korea China and is therefore the country with the most leverage over North Korea .

China has demonstrated that it is willing to take advantage of this leverage .

Earlier in the crisis China stopped oil supplies to North Korea for several days .

2 days after North Korean leader Kim Jong @-@ Il granted Dai the rare meeting for 14 July 2003 the regime 's Korean Central News Agency announced that China had recently decided to donate 10000 tons of diesel oil to North Korea .

Thailand will host ministers from China , Laos , India and Myanmar to discuss the elimination of precursor chemicals used in drug production .

Officials report that ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will hold talks this week in the northern Thai town of Chiang Rai aimed at eliminating precursor chemicals used in drug production .

The meeting will take place from 22 July 2003 - 25 July 2003 in one of the corners of the Golden Triangle and is the first of its kind .

Deputy chief of Thailand 's office of Narcotics Control Board ( ONCB ) rasanee Vistaveth stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand are expected to adopt the Chiang Rai Declaration which will touch on the countries ' commitment to solving the problem of drugs , particularly with regard to precursors and chemical trafficking .

Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are contained in legal medicines and are used to produce illegal stimulants including speed or ice which are produced in large quantities in Myanmar and then trafficked to Thailand and China and beyond .

Rasanee stated the ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand expect to openly discuss their countries ' weak points and the measures each country is taking to control these substances and prevent the substances from reaching the Golden Triangle area .

Rasanee said the governments of China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will explore ways to cooperate to intercept the illegal substances which are also used in legitimate industries .

Rasanee stated every country has its own way of controlling precursors but as matter of fact many precursors still flood the Golden Triangle area .

Rasanee referred to Thailand 's successful decades @-@ long campaign to eliminate poppy growing from its territory and reported that Thailand is willing to help and share its own expertise on opium elimination by training officials .

The ministers from China , Laos , India , Myanmar and Thailand will discuss how to find markets for goods produced under crop substitution and other related programs such as eco @-@ tourism and handicraft manufacturing .

La times probe finds strong evidence that Iran appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .

The Los Angeles Times in the 030804 edition Summarized results of an independent probe which strongly indicated that Iran is striving to become the world 's next nuclear power and appears to be in the late stages of developing the capacity to build a nuclear bomb .

The Los Angeles Times said the 3 @-@ month investigation drew on previously secret reports , international officials , independent experts , Iranian exiles and intelligence sources and uncovered strong evidence that Iran 's commercial program masked a military undertaking .

The Times report said that scientists from Russia , China , North Korea and Pakistan plus advancing technology have propelled Iran 's nuclear program much closer to producing a bomb than Iraq ever was .

The Times said a confidential report prepared by the French Government in 030500 concluded that Iran is surprisingly close to having enriched uranium or plutonium for a bomb .

The French government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to Iran and Iranian front companies .

The Times report said that samples of uranium taken by UN inspectors in Iran in 030600 tested positive for enrichment levels high enough to be consistent with an attempt to build a nuclear weapon .

The Iranian government also secretly imported 1.8 tons of nuclear material from China in 910000 and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal .

This uranium would be of no use in Iran 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production .

The Times quoted an unnamed Middle Eastern intelligence official that Pakistan 's role was bigger than thought from the beginning .

Abdul Qadeer Khan has helped Iran for years and is a Pakistani nuclear scientist regarded by the United States as a purveyor of nuclear secrets .

The Times said people inside Iran and foreign intelligence officials say that North Korean military scientists had been recently monitored entering Iranian nuclear facilities and are assisting in the design of a nuclear warhead .

There is a resort on the Caspian coast set aside for the exclusive use of North Koreans who are working on nuclear and missile projects in Iran .

Russian scientists sometimes travel to Iran under false identities and work without the Russian government 's approval to help complete a special reactor that could produce weapons @-@ grade plutonium .

The report said Iranians have also approached European companies in recent months to buy devices that can manipulate large volumes of radioactive material .

European intelligence sources said list of items the Iranians have wished to procure was a strong indication that Iran has moved to the late stages of weapons development .

Iran pledges to provide nuclear information to IAEA and sign nuclear protocol before 20040200 but not to indefinitely suspend uranium enrichment

Prior to 20031129 Rowhani had made no statement after the 20031126 IAEA resolution .

The suspension of uranium enrichment is provisional and voluntary and intended to build confidence .

Iran continues to refuse to indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reserves the right to recommence enrichment at any moment .

Iran 's uranium enrichment has prompted international concern that Iran may be capable of constructing an atomic bomb .

Iran stated that the purpose its nuclear activities is peaceful .

Rowhani stated that Iran wants to use enriched uranium to supply fuel for a future civil center .

Rowhani stated that the Iranian government will discuss with European governments the transfer of modern technology , nuclear technology and fuel to Iran .

Live poultry smuggling undermines WHO and FAO efforts to restrict bird flu spread in Asia .

FAO and WHO advise countries to tighten border security .

Smugglers are undermining international efforts headed by the UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) to eradicate bird flu by trafficking illegal live poultry that threaten to spread the disease to new areas .

Agriculture and customs officials have increased border checks throughout the affected region to halt illicit trade .

Most affected Asian countries have banned the import and export of live and slaughtered poultry to prevent the movement of potentially infected chickens and ducks across borders .

Senior FAO Animal Production and Health Officer in Asia Hans Wagner stated --

The FAO is concerned and well aware that there is copious uncontrolled movement of animals between borders in some Asian countries .

Smuggling occurs chiefly across the Green or uncontrolled borders of Vietnam , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar and China is likely a source for spreading the flu and other diseases .

Vietnam has experienced 9 flu fatalities and is the country worst affected by the disease .

Preventing smuggling from Vietnam is difficult because the country 's extensive land borders with China , Laos and Cambodia are poorly controlled by a notoriously corrupt customs department .

Cambodia has continuously been combating chicken and egg smuggling from Vietnam and is on high alert .

Approximately 8000 poultry and pig farmers were vaccinated against human flu to prevent it mutating with bird flu strains .

India is free of the disease but has deployed hundreds of soldiers to the border with Myanmar .

Myanmar has no reported H5N1 cases but Indian officials suspect that poultry could be smuggled through Myanmar from Thailand .

Thailand is one of the countries worst affected by the virus .

Hong Kong authorities have increased security along the border with China .

Customs spokesman Richard law stated that the Department performs frequent checks on smuggling activities and have now increased efforts to inspect cargoes .

Volkswagen AG rejects a Chinese newspaper report that it had put a stop to technology transfers of its Santana sedans to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .

The China Business Post reported 040209 that German auto giant Volkswagen AG had decided against the further transfer of a technical platform for the Santana sedan model to joint venture partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp ( SAIC ) .

The reported plan was for SAIC to produce a new sedan model designed on the Santana platform and with the car set to be launched in 040500 .

The China Business Post said the termination was due in part to Volkswagen 's adjustment of strategies regarding China and to ineffective communication with Volkswagen 's Chinese partners .

Volkswagen on 040209 rejected this China Business Post report that Volkswagen had put a stop to technology transfers of Santana sedans to SAIC .

Volkswagen group China spokeswoman Melanie Behrens said that the statements made in the China Business Post about the stop of knowledge transfer from VW to SAIC are not true .

Behrens said that Volkswagen does not know where these claims came from and is still working on the subject and trying to clarify the situation .

SAIC was not immediately available for comment .

Many Chinese car @-@ makers with overseas venture partners have begun researching and developing cars independently .

French anti @-@ terrorist judge calls terrorism serious threat despite dispersal and weakening of al @-@ Qaeda .

Restraining extremist groups is becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .

Al @-@ Qaeda is an organization which still exists but has been significantly weakened by the neutralization and capture of a number of its members and of those in charge .

Dozens of alleged members of al @-@ Qaeda have been captured or killed since the group claimed responsibility for the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington D.C. but authorities have not been able to locate al @-@ Qaeda 's leader Osama bin Laden or his top deputy Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri .

On 24 February 2004 Zawahiri appeared in 2 taped messages broadcast by the Arab @-@ language Al @-@ Arabiya and Al @-@ Jazeera television stations calling in remarks attributed to him for renewed attacks on the United States .

Restraining extremist groups particularly across Europe was becoming increasingly difficult because of how the groups are financed .

The networks operating in Europe benefit from micro @-@ financing and not from macro @-@ financing .

Fraudulent charge cards could be used to withdraw significant sums which are then distributed through micro @-@ channels outside the classic financial circles and are practically impossible to detect .

It is necessary to expand existing laws to combat the funding mechanisms .

All existing legal or institutional measures are insufficient to neutralize this threat .

Al @-@ Qaeda is only 1 of many worldwide threats among the many radical Islamic organizations involved in an international jihad and sharing the al @-@ Qaeda strategy that are pursuing regional options .

Amnesty International urges Laos to treat surrendered ethnic Hmong rebels humanely while Lao officials claim there are no rebels and no insurgency .

The rights group states that Lao troops promised rebels amnesty and a living area if they surrender but has received conflicting reports as to whether the Lao Government has upheld this agreement .

On 05 March 2004 Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to ensure that 100 s of ethnic Hmong anti @-@ government insurgents and their families who had reportedly surrendered were treated humanely .

Up to 700 insurgents and their relatives and 8 rebel commanders surrendered after government troops surrounded several northern holdouts in late February 2004 .

Troops used leaflets and megaphones to help communicate to the rebels that authorities would grant them amnesty and a special living area if they surrendered .

Approximately 300 people surrendered near Luang Prabang after traveling on foot from farther north and between 300 and 400 people surrendered in Xieng Khouang province .

Amnesty International stated it had received conflicting reports as to their reception and treatment by the authorities .

Following a series of deadly highway ambushes and bomb blasts the Lao Government called in August 2003 on Hmong and others whom they called ethnic minority bandits to lay down their arms , to come out from the forest and to rejoin society .

Small bands of ethnic minority rebels predominantly Hmong remain from the CIA @-@ sponsored guerrilla army mobilized to wage the United States ' secret campaign in Laos during the Vietnam War .

The Lao military has been accused by human rights groups of using harsh and often brutal tactics to eliminate them .

Amnesty International called on the Lao Government to provide UN agencies and other non @-@ governmental organizations access to all those who have put down their arms in order to assist with basic humanitarian needs .

It is essential that neutral observers are given access to these groups of former rebels in order to independently assess their situation and the veracity of ongoing claims of serious human rights violations being made by overseas ethnic Hmong groups .

The Lao Government should seize this opportunity to find a peaceful solution to decades of fighting and the high human cost on all sides of the conflict .

Diplomatic sources said on 070208 that EU sanctions against North Korea cannot go forward due to Britain 's disagreement with Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar inhibiting Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary from being listed as one of the required competent authorities .

The European Union decided in 061100 to ban the export of arms and nuclear and missile technology as well as luxury products in compliance with the UN resolution number 1718 adopted after Pyongyang carried out nuclear tests in 061000 .

The EU also introduced restrictions of entry to the EU for individuals deemed to be aiding North Korea 's programs for nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction .

Before the measures are applied , the legal sanctions document requires a list of authorities , banks and other bodies in each Member State which would supervise compliance with the sanctions and freeze assets .

British spokeswoman Vicky Courtney in Brussels said Britain insisted that Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary be listed as the competent authority as had done on previous occasions without Spain making any complaint .

Gibraltar 's Chief Secretary acts as the link between the gibraltan government and the British government and Governor .

Another diplomatic source , said the Spanish government was afraid that any mention of a gibraltan authority would constitute a precedent in relations between the EU and Gibraltar and so opposed the move this time .

The Spanish Government refuses to afford any international legitimacy to Gibraltar .

The UK and Spain are seeking to reach a formula which would satisfy both sides .

The 2 EU nations have thus far failed to do so .

Other EU @-@ levied sanctions include those against Iran over the Iranian nuclear program .

Gibraltarians in 020000 overwhelmingly rejected moves by Britain and Spain to move towards joint sovereignty for Gibraltar and Gibraltar 's 30000 inhabitants .

20070302 Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi stated in an interview published on the BBC website --

Britain , the EU and the US have not invested in Libya following the country 's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program .

The NPT has 188 signatory States and is a deal in which nuclear weapons States agree to disarm while nations without the bomb agree not to seek the bomb .

The meeting in May 2005 failed to resolve any key questions due to an agenda disagreement between non @-@ aligned countries and nuclear powers .

The crisis over Iran 's atomic program escalates though Iran has not yet produced atomic bombs .

A U.S. strategy to use pre @-@ emptive force if judged necessary and Britian 's nuclear arsenal upgrade threaten the NPT .

The States also include North Korea which withdrew from the treaty and 3 nuclear states including India , Pakistan and Israel which have refused to sign the NPT .

Diplomats and experts stated the preparatory session can not change the treaty but is expected to focus on problems in fighting proliferation and in getting the 5 original nuclear weapons states to fulfill the NPT commitment to disarm which is a focus of non @-@ aligned States .

Nuclear and disarmement expert Rebecca Johnson wrote the week of 22 April 2007 on Johnson 's Acronym Institute website that the risk of nuclear proliferation is too grave for the international community to shirk responsibilities and that the NPT has already begun to unravel .

Felicity Hill of the non @-@ governmental organization the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons ( ican ) stated to AFP that the meeting could build towards a successful 2010 Review Conference but progress must occur on both non @-@ proliferation and disarmament .

A diplomat in Vienna who closely follows the non @-@ proliferation regime stated that expectations are being lowered for a successful outcome to the Preparatory Committee given the inauspicious international developments and the growing detritus of arms control agreements cast aside .

Afghanistan accounts for 92 percent of the world 's heroin supply despite vast internationally @-@ backed efforts to eradicate its opium poppy fields .

Oguz said the annual income from the drugs trade helps finance the Taliban @-@ led insurgency plaguing mainly southern and eastern Afghanistan and that this income totals more than three billion US dollars .

Oguz fears that Afghanistan will have at least the same amount as the 2006 harvest if not more .

Oguz also downplayed international efforts to eradicate poppy crops and said that it was more important to provide poor opium farmers with alternative livelihoods .

In a state of the nation speech in 20070400 Putin stated that Russia should announce a moratorium on adherence to the CFE Treaty until all NATO countries have ratified the Treaty .

The CFE Treaty limits the deployment of tanks and troops in NATO and former Eastern European Warsaw Pact countries and establishes confidence @-@ building , transparency and cooperation measures between Member States .

The treaty was signed in Paris in 1990 and came into force in 1992 .

The treaty was adapted in Istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in order to limit deployments on a country @-@ by @-@ country basis .

China 's main priority in the event of instability in North Korea would be prevention of an influx of refugees by assuring supplies of food and strengthening border controls .

PLA officers stated that they would attempt to close the border but admit a lack of confidence that they could do so successfully because the border extends 866 miles and can be easily penetrated .

UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .

Drug production will be a main focus of a meeting in Tokyo to assess progress in Afghanistan .

UN Office on Drugs and Crime representative Christina Oguz stated that Afghanistan has done little to stop the corruption enabling drug trade and Afghanistan 's institutions are too weak to combat drug trade .

Oguz stated to AFP in an interview that the drug industry in Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world 's illegal opium and that ending the industry in Afghanistan will take decades .

Drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in Tokyo on 5 February 2008 through 6 February 2008 to assess progress in Afghanistan .

A paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistanâ€™s stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities .

The source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement Afghanistan 's 5 @-@ year reconstruction plan .

The fact that President Hamid Karzai has not appointed a counternarcotics minister to replace the minister who resigned in July 2008 indicates the priority given to drug production even though Karzai has said drug production is 1 of the most important issues for Afghanistan to tackle .

Very little has been done to fight corruption .

Corruption feeds the industry in that farmers often have to pay a 10 percent tax to Afghan officials or Taliban insurgents .

No one questions how people have very low salaries but drive in expensive cars and live in expensive houses .

Some are not living in Afghanistan despite being Afghans .

Afghanistan 's opium is increasingly converted into heroin inside Afghanistan and supplies drug users in Europe , Central Asia and the Middle East .

Oguz stated blaming Afghanistan for the world 's heroin problem would be unfair as heroin production is a shared responsibility .

Chemicals needed to turn opium into heroin come primarily from the developed world and are illegally sent to Afghanistan .

Oguz stated the national strategy to deal with the drugs trade should be tailored to the different circumstances in the 34 provinces .

The focus should be on interdiction in southern Afghanistan because of the common interest between insurgents and drug traffickers to keep the south out of reach from the government in Kabul and the international aid community .

The north and center of Afghanistan have more order and government structure and should be offered incentives like development to persuade farmers and other players to cease opium production .

Oguz stated the drug trade links into corruption and the insurgency and will not be an easy task to combat .

Oguz stated combating the drug trade in Thailand took 20 years even though Thailand had some functioning institutions .

The Intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board suggested that Iran continued to work on nuclear weapons beyond the 030000 date cited in a recent United States intelligence report .

The Iranian government has dismissed the allegations in the intelligence presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board as baseless and the intelligence used to support the allegations as fake .

Iran warns that new UN resolution against Iran 's nuclear program will complicate the nuclear issue .

IAEA meets in Vienna to discuss Iran issue .

A new UN Security Council resolution against Iran 's nuclear activities would be irrational and unlawful and complicate the standoff with Western nations rather than promoting resolution of the issue .

Supporters should be held accountable for their illegal act .

20080303 the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) board of governors met in Vienna to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue .

IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei demanded that Iran address allegations of involvement in covert nuclear weapons work .

Iran denies seeking atomic weapons and claims that only to endeavor to enrich uranium to lower levels to create nuclear fuel for its rapidly increasing population .

Iran demands the closing of the nuclear case because the most recent IAEA report stated that the Agency had made important progress in a 4 @-@ year examination of Iran 's nuclear program .

The Agency remains unable to confirm the nature of Iran 's nuclear program .

Iran continues to defy UN demands to suspend uranium enrichment .

Intelligence presented to the IAEA board the week of 20080225 suggested that Iran was involved in military research indicating non @-@ conventional weapon development .

Iran dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious .

Saeedi stated that the Iranian Government has submitted an assessment of the claimed studies and has no remaining commitments in the matter .

Diplomats stated that the IAEA board was considering tabling a resolution pressuring Iran to reveal its disputed nuclear activities .

The UN Security Council planned to increase sanctions on Iran later on 20080303 in an attempt to force Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment that the West fears is aimed at producing a secret nuclear weapon .

Depending on the outcome of the Security Council vote , the IAEA board is considering tabling a separate resolution demanding that Iran reveal its disputed nuclear activities .

The IAEA Board does not intend to undermine the primary action of the UN Security Council in New York but a resolution would emphasize the Agency 's continued interest in the Iranian nuclear issue .

The Board is likely to support the Security Council 's call for Iran to suspend its enrichment @-@ related activities

Indications of weapons work constituting a violation of NPT obligations and Iran 's violation of Security Council resolutions provide strong reason for the Security Council and the IAEA to continue to investigate Iran .

Iran addressed the majority of outstanding questions about its past nuclear program but refused to address allegations about its purported nuclear weapons work .

Iran is pursuing and expanding uranium enrichment in flagrant violation of UN demands .

Enriched uranium can be used to make the fissile material for an atomic bomb .

Iran continued nuclear weapons work beyond the 2003 date cited in a recent US intelligence report .

Iran has dismissed the allegations as baseless and the intelligence used to back them as spurious .

20080303 Iranian Ambassador Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to reporters that the alleged weaponization studies covered activities that were not strictly nuclear and therefore did not fall under IAEA jurisdiction .

ElBaradei stated in the opening address to the IAEA board --

Addressing the allegations is necessary to enable the Agency to determine the nature and scope of all of Iran 's past nuclear activities .

Iran should be as active and as cooperative as possible in working with the IAEA to clarify this matter of serious concern .

Iran Criticizes UN Security Council for imposing sanctions against Iran 's nuclear program in order to appease Western countries .

UN Security Council sanctions over the Iranian nuclear program reveal that the Security Council has been manipulated to implement the foreign policy of Western countries and undermine the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .

The resolution is illegitimate and illegal .

20080303 the UN Security Council imposed the 3 rd set of sanctions against Iran in 15 months to castigate Iran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment potentially used to create nuclear weapons .

Iran must comply with UN and IAEA demands to suspend uranium enrichment within 3 months .

Shipments to and from Iran suspected of containing prohibited goods must be inspected .

States are encouraged to exercise vigilance in entering new commitments for public @-@ provided financial support for trade with Iran , including the granting of export credits .

President Mahmoud ahmadinejad has stated that previous resolutions are inconsequential and the sanctions will have no impact on Iran 's nuclear program .

The resolution received low @-@ profile coverage on state television and was absent from leading news headlines .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated that Israel possesses the necessary power to defend itself against any threat from Iran .

Iranian officials considered the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA 's latest report a success for Iran despite the Agency 's inability to confirm that the nuclear program was peaceful .

Stop major regional terror networks from proliferating

Ukraine almost has all of the necessary approvals to join the European Space Agency 's program .

Ukraine is considered likely to gain the remaining approvals which will allow Ukraine to join the program and share its renowned space technologies .

The European Space Agency recommended on June 6 , 2002 that Ukraine join a multinational program that could greatly expand markets for Ukrainian space technology .

Head of the European Space Agency 's technology transfer program Pierre Brisson stated that the European Space Agency will have to ask the European Commission before confirming Ukraine can join the program .

Pierre Brisson also stated that the European Commission will most likely issue approval by August 5 , 2002 and work on the project could start on December 5 , 2002 .

The Ukrainian Government must also approve the Ukraine 's participation in the program but Deputy Director of Ukraine 's national space agency Eduard Kuznetsov stated that no problems are expected because of President Leonid Kuchma 's pro @-@ European goals .

The European Space Agency 's endorsement followed Ukraine 's formal announcement to bid to join NATO on May 29 , 2002 .

Pierre Brisson led a team of European experts on a visit to Kiev to discuss commercial applications of Ukrainian space technology with representatives of the National Space Agency of Ukraine , scientists and business leaders .

Pierre Brisson stated that Ukraine 's materials and processing sectors are the most immediately promising to other European clients and could have a large impact on the future .

Eduard Kuznetsov stated that the space sector will outperform Ukraine 's overall integration schedules because the branch already has a record of international cooperation .

Ukraine is an impoverished former Soviet republic that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since a space power .

President Leonid Kuchma 's goal for Ukraine is greater integration into Europe .

Fathers of militants killed in Kashmir vow to continue support for independence

Mohammed Aziz 's son Imam was killed in Kashmir in January 2002 .

Imam was Aziz 's eldest son .

Aziz stated that he would not hesitate to sacrifice his remaining four sons for Kashmiri independence .

Aziz is angry that President Pervez Musharraf will obstruct Pakistan 's the militant Islamic groups that send fighters into the Indian @-@ ruled portion of Kashmir .

Aziz stated his pride of being a father of a martyr and that President Musharraf has sold the blood of hundreds of freedom fighters by stopping men from waging jihad in Kashmir .

Political and religious groups vowed to fight for Kashmir despite Musharraf 's promise to stop militants based in Pakistan from crossing into Indian @-@ controlled territory to stage attacks .

Militant groups that oppose Musharraf 's crackdown and Musharraf 's support for the U.S. @-@ led war in Afghanistan have been blamed for attacks targeting foreigners and symbols of Western influence in Pakistan .

Musharraf pledged to stop cross @-@ border infiltration because of pressure from the United States .

The dispute over Kashmir began when India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947 .

The two countries both have nuclear weapons and have fought two wars over Kashmir .

There are increased tensions of war between India and Pakistan after an attack on an Indian army camp .

Cuban biotechnology pharmaceuticals program seeks to expand to overseas markets in developing countries .

The Cuban Government seeks to increase pharmaceutical profits by significantly expanding overseas markets through the development of novel pharmaceuticals and the sale of the world 's most lucrative biotechnology drug , erythropoetin ( EPO ) .

Amgen Inc. invented EPO and shares patent rights with Johnson & Johnson and Kirin Brewery in the most lucrative industrialized markets -- the US , Europe and Japan .

In 2001 EPO generated 6 billion dollars in sales for the 3 corporations .

US epogen consumers pay over 10000 dollars each annually for the drug .

EPO is a genetically engineered protein used legally by kidney dialysis and chemotherapy patients and illegally by athletes to increase the concentration of oxygenated red blood cells .

An increasing quantity of biotechnology drugs are produced without any attempts to obtain licenses in developing nations .

US patent holders consider the trade in generic drugs a violation to their intellectual property .

Cuba considers the generic drug trade good business and currently manufactures EPO for sale in Argentina , Brazil , India and other countries that do not acknowledge most US and European drug patents .

Cuban biotechnology executive Blanca tormo stated that Cuba carefully abides by intellectual property laws and exclusively sells EPO in countries in which no entity has exclusive patent rights .

By joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 China agreed to abide by WTO intellectual property agreements but the agreements contain mechanisms allowing developing nations to circumvent patents , particularly in pharmaceuticals , when public health concerns are deemed to override the patents .

The Cuban biotechnology industry currently generates 100 million dollars annually and reaches markets in over 40 countries .

Cuba 's genetic engineering and biotechnology center occupies modern towers approved by Fidel Castro and employs over 1000 people to engineer proteins to combat major terminal illnesses .

Cuba currently produces novel biotechnology products : hepatitis B and meningitis B vaccines , a skin growth factor , interferons , thrombosis and heart attack medicines and AIDS treatments .

Cuba licensed its meningitis B vaccine to the British company GlaxoSmithKline , which hopes to eventually sell the vaccine in the United States under a Clinton @-@ era exemption to the Cuban trade embargo .

Cuba is seeking further partnerships with foreign companies in vaccine research for AIDS , 8 types of cancer and cholera .

Cuban officials including attendees of the annual bio 2002 Industry Conference 20020600 in Toronto stated that negotiations for new biotechnology trade and production agreements were in progress with Brazil , Malaysia , Netherlands , Spain , Mexico , Venezuela , Vietnam , Ukraine , Germany and the United States .

Cuba has or is negotiating technology transfer agreements with 14 countries , chiefly developing nations including India , Algeria and South Africa .

20020500 US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton stated that the US believes Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort and has provided dual @-@ use biotechnology to other rogue states .

Scientists , Castro , and former US President Jimmy Carter , who visited Cuba directly after Bolton 's statement , dismissed Bolton 's statement as unfair .

Tormo stated that Bolton unintentionally increased publicity for the Cuban biotechnology program .

The Russian military space forces on 020718 inaugurated an optical tracking facility that is intended to monitor objects in space and put it on test duty .

The okno optical tracking facility is near the town of Nurek in the central region of the ex @-@ Soviet republic of Tajikistan and located 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the Tajik capital Dushanbe .

The okno offers a better range and precision than standard radar facilities according to the Space Forces .

The report saids Space Forces chief Col . @-@ Gen . Anatoly Perminov traveled to the site to report on the facility 's launch to Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , .

The okno is located in Tajikistan 's mountains 2200 meters ( 7260 feet ) above sea level and takes advantage of the area 's fine weather and high transparency of the atmosphere .

The construction of the facility started in 790000 , but stopped after the 910000 Soviet collapse when Tajikistan slid into a 5 year civil war that undermined its economy and left its population in deep poverty .

About 25000 Russian troops and border guards are deployed in Tajikistan to help protect its volatile southern border with Afghanistan and prevent drug smuggling .

The goal of the initiative is to provide the infrastructure and good governance needed to alleviate poverty .

Premier Silvio Berlusconi supported and sponsored the initiative with counterparts at recent international gatherings including the last G @-@ 8 Summit in Canada .

Italy persuaded partners to let Italy lead the G @-@ 8 summit 's e @-@ government initiative called DOT Force or digital opportunity task force .

Former IBM executive and current technology minister of Italy Lucio Stanca is leading Italy 's Internet program for developing countries as part of the Group of Eight 's efforts to reduce the digital divides .

Silvio Berlusconi gave Lucio Stanca his current role of modernizing Italy 's bureaucracy .

Lucio Stanca stated that Italy will not targeting countries that have very basic needs .

So far 12 million euros or 12 million dollars have been allocated to finance the initial phase of these projects .

Lucio Stanca stated that the world must solve the problem of world hunger , disease and education but in order to do that the world must first help create good governance .

The rationale behind creating good governance is that by making the public administration of developing countries more transparent and accountable developing countries would become more attractive potential recipients of traditional forms of aid such as loans and investments .

In effect good governance would invalidate the reason used by countries that do not do enough that donating is not appropriate because it is impossible to know whether the aid would reach its true destination .

Other studies note that even though the Internet has been in use for more than a decade , only about 10 percent of the world 's population has access to it .

The United Nations has repeatedly stated that the world 's poor may be further marginalized if there is no improvement in access to information technology .

Italy launched pilot programs in 5 countries at a conference in Sicily sponsored by the United Nations and Italy in April , 2002 .

The plan for Albania is computerization of demographic surveys .

Indian Deputy Prime Minister accuses Pakistan of becoming a haven for terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and permitting increasing guerrilla attacks in Kashmir .

Intelligence reports state that al @-@ Qaeda members have fled from American forces in Afghanistan and relocated to western Pakistan and Pakistan @-@ controlled Kashmir , making Pakistan the new epicenter of terrorism .

The international community must beware of the situation , which could prove expensive for any country .

India should resolve its issues with Pakistan including the core issue of Kashmir to ensure durable peace in the region , rather than accuse Pakistan .

Pakistani and American officials stated that over 400 Taliban and al @-@ Qaeda suspects have been arrested in Pakistan .

20021228 the head of the Pakistan @-@ based guerrilla group Hezb @-@ ul Mujahadeen Syed Salahuddin stated at a meeting of Hezb commanders in mazzafarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir , that Hezb will continue and increase jihad in the Indian state of Jammu @-@ Kashmir with full force .

Hezb is the largest of over 12 militias battling Indian troops for Kashmir 's independence from mostly Hindu India , or its merger with Islamic Pakistan .

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 's assurance to the United States of ending cross @-@ border terrorism in Kashmir , terminating militant camps and banning dozens of Islamic groups was merely cosmetic .

Many of the banned terrorist groups continued activity in Pakistan and Kashmir under new names .

The Indian army stated that 4 Islamic militants were killed in 2 separate gun battles 20021228 .

Indian army spokesman Lt.Col . Mukhtar Singh stated that soldiers stormed a militant hideout in Kreeri , a village 35 kilometers north of Srinagar , Jammu @-@ Kashmir 's summer capital .

Philippine intelligence reports reveal Singapore @-@ based al @-@ Qaida group 's plans to bomb embassies , U.S. corporations , and warships in Singapore and to crash hijacked planes at Singapore 's National Airport .

Philippine intelligence reports obtained by the Associated Press reveal a Singapore @-@ based al @-@ Qaida group 's plans to attack embassies of the United States , Great Britain , Israel and Australia , to attack U.S. corporations and warships in Singapore and to crash a hijacked plane at the country 's international airport .

The amount is 4 times the amount of explosive that Timothy McVeigh used to bomb the Oklahoma City Federal Building .

The embassy attacks were successfully stopped in the final stages by U.S. investigators and allies in Southeast Asia but the explosives were not recovered .

1 of the phillipine reports states that Singapore is a target for terrorist attacks because of its 17000 U.S. residents and 6000 multinational companies including several American companies .

The terrorists belonged to Jemaah Islamiah designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization and described in 1 of the phillipine reports as part of the broader al @-@ Qaida syndicate .

The group planned attacks in Singapore before and after the hijackings in the United States on 11 September 2001 .

The group is suspected in the bombings in Bali that killed approximately 200 people in October 2002 .

1 of the Philippine reports stated that local officials and Western business executives were shocked by the ability of Al @-@ Qaida to plant operatives in such a tightly controlled society as Singapore .

The members of the 4 or 5 @-@ man terror cells led normal lives and avoided contact with known Islamic organizations .

In efforts to avoid detection the members used code names and code numbers , communicated by e @-@ mail , encrypted their computer diskettes and used prepaid mobile phone cards .

Investigators stated that after the U.S. military campaign began in Afghanistan members of Jemaah Islamiah planned to procure 21 tons of explosive materials and bought 4 tons of ammonium nitrate in an operation to attack embassies in Singapore .

The ammonium nitrate was purchased by captured Malaysian chemist and retired army captain Yazid Sufaat .

Authorities state that Sufaat hosted 11 September hijackers and the accused terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui in Malaysia at different times in 2000 .

Authorities state that Sufaat provided Moussaoui with counterfeit documents with which to enter the United States .

Moussaoui was arrested in August 2001 in Minnesota and remains the only U.S. defendant indicted as a conspirator with the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks .

The Singaporean cell members were believed to be conducting reconnaissance when they were apprehended .

In a separate plot a member of the cell took digital photographs of U.S. military aircraft and personnel using Singapore 's Paya Lebar air base .

Singapore authorities believe a cell leader traveled to Afghanistan and briefed al @-@ Qaida leaders about the proposed shuttle bus attack between August 1999 and April 2000 .

A few days after the Singapore arrests in December 2001 a videotape was found in an abandoned house in Kabul , Afghanistan in which a narrator describes locations in Singapore where bombs could be hidden to attack Americans .

Investigators searched the homes of those detained in Singapore and found an identical videotape .

The Singapore wing of Jemaah Islamiah may also have Thai connections since at least 5 members who eluded the 2001 arrests fled to Thailand .

The Group had further planned to hijack a U.S. , British or Singaporean plane and crash it into Changi Airport in order to threaten the U.S. government to halt its military strikes against Afghanistan .

In February 2003 Indonesian police announced the arrest of the alleged head of the cell in Singapore Mas Selamat Kastari who was suspected of planning the airport attack .

The reports arose after intelligence agents from Southeast Asian countries realized after the 11 September 2001 attacks that many radical Islamic groups in the region had close connections to each other and to Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network .

The Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported the incoming South Korean government of President @-@ elect Lee Myung @-@ bak was considering a foreign ministry suggestion that South Korea should consider becoming a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative .

The Proliferation Security Initiative calls for stopping and searching ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction .

The South Korean Foreign Ministry reportedly made the recommendation suggesting that South Korea should consider becoming a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative during a briefing to the South Korean government transition team on 080104 .

The Chosun Ilbo newspaper report stated that the South Korean Foreign Ministry stated that becoming a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative would be helpful in strengthening South Korea 's alliance with the United States .

The South Korean Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cho Hee @-@ Yong also declined to confirm that the South Korean Foreign Ministry had made the proposal suggesting that South Korea should consider becoming a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative .

In a 1 sentence statement issued later in the day on 080112 Cho Hee @-@ Yong stated that there is no change in the South Korean government 's basic position that we support the purpose and principle of the Proliferation Security Initiative and South Korea will adjust the scope of South Korea 's participation according to South Korea 's judgment .

Park Jung @-@ Ha stated without any further elaboration to the Associated Press that the incoming South Korean government have not discussed the Proliferation Security Initiative at all .

The North Korean government has warned the South Korean government against participating in the Proliferation Security Initiative program .

The Proliferation Security Initiative was launched in 030000 primarily to deter trade in missile and nuclear technology by States such as North Korea and Iran .

Countries participating in the proliferation security initiative hold maritime drills to search ships suspected of carrying nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , materials to make these weapons , or missiles to deliver these weapons .

South Korea has only been an observer to the Proliferation Security Initiative Program and the South Korean government has so far refused United States requests to become a full member of the Proliferation Security Initiative program .

The South Korean government has stated that South Korea does not want to provoke North Korea .

North Korea views the Proliferation Security Initiative program as a United States attempt to overthrow the Communist regime in North Korea .

Lee Myung @-@ bak has stated that he would strengthen relations with the United States because the United States and South Korea lacked trust under the outgoing South Korean administration .

The Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil build a nuclear submarine .

It also wants to establish a strategic partnership with France involving exchange of experiences and knowledge and hopes to discuss deals involving France 's Rafale fighter jet and the Cougar cargo helicopter .

Brazil 's Defense Ministry said 080128 that the Brazilian Government is seeking to buy military technology from France that could help Brazil become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine .

Ramos said that any defense @-@ related agreement that may eventually be signed with the Government of France must include the transfer of technology and noted that Brazil has nuclear reactors and fuel enrichment capacity but has not had the technology to build a nuclear submarine .

Ramos declined to confirm a report published 080128 by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper saying that the Brazilian Government would buy the submarine for US $ 600 million and pay off the amount over 20 years at an annual interest rate of 2.4 percent .

The Brazilian Government has discussed building a nuclear submarine for decades and began a formal program in 1979 .

Executive Director of Washington @-@ based nonpartisan research group Arms Control Association Daryl Kimball said that Brazil will surely become the first country in Latin America to have a nuclear submarine if a Brazil @-@ France agreement results in the construction of a nuclear submarine .

Ramos said the Brazilian government wants to establish a strategic partnership with France which would involve the exchange of experiences and knowledge and noted that France is interested in Brazilian jungle warfare knowledge in terms of both tactics and the use of electronic equipment in the humidity of tropical rain forests .

Ramos said that the Brazilian government also hopes to discuss deals involving France 's Rafale fighter jet and the Cougar cargo helicopter but gave no additional details .

International Atomic Energy Agency director ElBaradei says the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .

Director General of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei told a conference of the world 's top defense officials on 080209 that the biggest danger facing the world is not new nuclear States but the risk of extremist groups obtaining atomic weapons .

ElBaradei urged a reduction of the world 's nuclear stockpile and better controls and said that an extremist group would use nuclear weapons upon procuring such weapons .

ElBaradei said that even countries which have nuclear weapons know that a country which uses nuclear weapons will be pulverized but that extremist groups will use nuclear weapons if possible .

ElBaradei said that countries need to be aware that extremist groups procuring nuclear weapons is the number one security threat the world is facing and added as a note of caution that given the state of the system of international controls it was hard to determine whether nuclear materials were ending up with extremist groups .

ElBaradei said much of the material that is reported stolen is never recovered and that a lot of the material recovered has never been reported stolen .

ElBaradei said in reference to Iran that the international community should quickly engage in talks with the Iranian government to secure guarantees that the Iranian nuclear program will not be used to develop weapons and that such confidence can only be built through direct negotiations .

U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman said that Iran remained the world 's top arms control challenge and that it would be a profound mistake to focus on the recent U.S. national intelligence estimate that suggested Iran no longer had a nuclear weapons program .

Lieberman pointed out that in the Nie report which said that the Iranian government 's covert work on bomb design may have been temporarily suspended in 03000 it was also and far more importantly stated that Iran 's overt work on enrichment continues apace .

Steinmeier consequently believes it is right for the international community to keep up the pressure on Iran .

Steinmeier said that in the interests of global safety the international community 's common goals must continue to be to prevent Iranian nuclear armament and to counteract the erosion of the Nonproliferation Treaty .

An expert stated on February 14 , 2008 that top transplant surgeons in Austria are collaborating with criminal organ trafficking networks to target desperate people .

Nancy schepeter @-@ Hughes stated that most victims of kidney trafficking are coerced by need and not by physical force .

In Brazil people were competing to be chosen for kidney trafficking .

Nancy schepeter @-@ Hughes stated that trafficking does not have to be transnational and can also be found within countries .

The Vienna Forum ends on February 15 , 2008 and is being convened by the United Nations global initiative to fight human trafficking .

Nancy scheper @-@ Hughes is Founding Director of organs Watch , a professor , and the Director of University of California at Berkeley 's medical anthropology program .

The United Kingdom 's Foreign Office released an early version of a 020000 dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq that became vital to Tony Blair 's case for going to war in Iraq .

On 080218 the United Kingdom 's Foreign Office released an early version of a 020000 dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq that became vital to Tony Blair 's case for going to war in Iraq .

The dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq includes references to intelligence claims that Iraq had acquired uranium and had equipment necessary to produce chemical weapons .

The dossier of prewar intelligence on Iraq does not contain a claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes .

The claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was an allegation that became crucial to Blair 's support of the 030000 United States led invasion of Iraq and the allegation was later discredited .

Freedom of Information campaigners allege the assertion that that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was inserted into later drafts of the dossier of prewar intelligence shortly before the dossier was published on the orders of Tony Blair 's office in order to strengthen the case for war in Iraq .

The final draft of the joint intelligence committee dossier included the claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes .

A second document was published in 030200 was found to have repeated verbatim parts of an academic study on Iraq 's supposed concealment of weapons of mass destruction .

The second document that was published in 030200 became known as the dodgy dossier .

Hans Blix stated in 070000 that Hans Blix believed that Tony Blair had replaced question marks with exclamation marks in intelligence dossiers to justify the decision to invade Iraq .

Lord Butler 's 2004 official inquiry criticized intelligence officials for relying in part on seriously flawed or unreliable sources .

Lord Butler stated that the dossiers had pushed the Government of the United Kingdom 's case to the limits of available intelligence and left out vital caveats .

United Kingdom 's government weapons scientist David Kelly killed himself in 030000 after he was exposed as the source of a British Broadcasting Corporation report that accused Tony Blair 's Downing Street office of embellishing intelligence to make a stronger case for war in Iraq .

On 080218 John Williams stated in The Guardian newspaper that many within United Kingdom 's government had failed to find problems with Tony Blair 's case for joining the invasion of Iraq .

On 080218 John Williams stated in The Guardian newspaper that other people were more perceptive than the many within United Kingdom 's government had failed to find problems with Tony Blair 's case for joining the invasion of Iraq and that one of these more perceptive people was the former United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Robin Cook .

David Miliband criticized the decision of freedom of information authorities to order the release of the John Williams document .

David Miliband stated in writing that officials and other people who draft policy documents should not feel constrained in presenting free and frank advice through fear that their ideas will be made public .

Robin Cook resigned from Tony Blair 's cabinet in opposition to the Iraq war because Robin Cook claimed he could not support military action without international approval .

John Williams wrote in The Guardian newspaper on 080218 that Robin Cook was right and the people who carried on working for the Government of the United Kingdom were wrong .

David Miliband criticized the decision of freedom of information authorities to order the release of John Williams written statement .

Colombian officials have already disclosed that officials found documents suggesting the rebels have bought and sold uranium .

The Conference on Disarmament contains 65 members .

Colombia stated on March 3 , 2008 that the country found computer documents suggesting the rebels have bought and sold uranium .

Colombia is worried about rebel plan involving obtaining uranium but has no evidence of plot for dirty bomb .

The Colombian government is worried about documents on the laptop of a slain rebel leader indicating the guerrillas were trying to obtain uranium .

Tovar wrote the deal would be with a Government and to sell them a sizable amount .

Tovar wrote Belisario had 50 kilos ready and could sell a lot more as Belisario had direct contact with uranium suppliers .

Gen. Oscar Naranjo said at an explosive news conference that the FARC mentioning negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium means that the FARC are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor and were not just domestic guerrillas but transnational terrorists .

Colombian officials say they have no other information from the laptop or other sources indicating FARC interest in radioactive materials or unconventional weapons .

It was n't clear what exactly the material Tovar was writing about might be .

The price mentioned suggests that the uranium would be processed and hence dangerous .

Charles Ferguson is a physicist with the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and said that unprocessed uranium is relatively harmless and goes for about US $ 100 a kilo .

Ferguson expressed fear if the uranium in question were the highly enriched weapons @-@ grade uranium capable of being used in a low @-@ yield improvised nuclear device .

Ferguson was not aware of any highly enriched uranium of appreciable quantities in the region near Colombia and Venezuela .

A parliamentary commission report stated on April 9 , 2008 that money from drug trafficking in Bulgaria has been used to fund terrorist groups .

The report said that part of the profit from trafficking in drugs such as amphetamines has been used to finance terrorist organizations like Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad , and Christian militias in Lebanon .

The U.S. State Department said in its 2008 international narcotics control strategy report that Bulgaria continues to be a source of drug production .

Bulgaria 's government has been repeatedly criticized by the European Union over its inability to tackle rampant corruption and organized crime .

Bulgaria is a Balkan country of 7.7 million people and lies on a major drug trafficking route linking Western Europe , the Middle East and southwestern Asia .

25 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were convicted and sentenced to jail time while 15 members were acquitted .

The charges against members of the Muslim Brotherhood included money laundering and terrorism .

A security official stated that on 15 April 2008 an Egyptian military court known for severe verdicts convicted 25 key members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood with sentences up to 10 years in jail .

The security official attended the trial at the court north of Cairo but spoke on condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to speak to the media .

The official stated the charges against members of Egypt 's largest opposition group included money laundering and terrorism but it was not immediately clear if the 25 were found guilty of both offenses .

Police searched vehicles and drove away reporters and family members of the defendants .

Defense lawyer Abdel @-@ Moneim Abdel @-@ Maksoud stated the judge entered the courtroom and issued the ruling but then left without notifying the opposition group 's defense lawyers who stood outside the courthouse after being prevented by policemen from entering the courtroom .

The 25 sentenced included the Brotherhood 's chief strategist Khayrat El @-@ Shater and the Brotherhood 's prominent financier and businessman Hassan Malek .

El @-@ Shater joined the Brotherhood in 1974 and has been jailed 4 times for a total of 7 years on charges relating to membership in the Brotherhood which was outlawed before 1958 .

Malek owns a chain of furniture stores and textile factories and is known as 1 of the Brotherhood 's main financiers .

El @-@ Shater and Malek each received 7 @-@ year sentences .

El @-@ Shater and Malek 's property was confiscated and is believed to be worth millions of dollars .

The Brotherhood figures were referred to a military court after the arrests .

The referral is authorized under emergency laws in effect since 1981 that allow the president to refer civilians to military tribunals .

7 senior figures were tried in absentia and are believed to be outside the country .

5 of the absent senior figures received 10 @-@ year prison terms including Swiss @-@ based Egyptian @-@ born businessman Youssef M. Nada whose company has been listed by the United States since 2001 as an organization accused of helping fund terrorism .

London @-@ based human rights group Amnesty International called the sentences on 15 April 2008 a perversion of justice and demanded the men be released and retried in a civilian court .

Amnesty International said in a statement that the sentences leave little doubt that the Egyptian authorities are determined to undermine what has become the main opposition group in Egypt .

Amnesty International stated trying civilians before military courts flouts international standards of fair trial and is inherently unjust .

The Muslim Brotherhood 's supreme leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef denounced the verdict and stated that Egyptian authorities are corrupt gangsters .

Akef stated to the Associated Press that there was no evidence against the convicted and that acquittals for the convicted are expected .

Akef stated in a telephone interview that gangs not politicians rule Egypt .

The Brotherhood won 88 of parliament 's 454 seats in the 2005 elections with Brotherhood candidates running as independents .

South African government officials will not intervene to disallow Chinese arms shipment to Zimbabwe despite volatile political situation following contested presidential election .

South African officials approved transit of the arms shipment to Zimbabwe stating it cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .

On 17 April 2008 a South African government spokesman stated that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese @-@ made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe despite the acute instability of the political situation in Zimbabwe .

South African government spokesman Themba Maseko stated that the Zimbabwean government 's failure to release election results 2 weeks after elections is cause for great concern and that the dire situation requires mediation .

Mbeki has stated that there is no crisis in Zimbabwe despite the increasing violence and intimidation since the 29 March 2008 vote and the refusal of Zimbabwe 's election commission to release results that independent observers and the opposition State show President Robert Mugabe lost the vote .

Criticism increased on 17 April 2008 following a report that South African mediator Sydney Mufamadi led an arms control committee meeting that approved transit of a shipment of Chinese weapons across South African territory en route to Zimbabwe .

The Chinese ship called an Yue Jiang docked in Durban harbor in South Africa after receiving approval from Port authorities late on 16 April 2008 .

The Beeld newspaper stated the ship was carrying approximately 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK @-@ 47s , approximately 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket @-@ propelled grenades .

A South African government official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the presence of weapons on the ship but gave no further details .

Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not immediately be reached for comment .

Government spokesman Maseko stated that if administrative papers are in order the Government of South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons from being transported through its territory to a neighboring landlocked country .

The Government of South Africa cannot act unilaterally to prevent a trade deal between 2 countries .

It would be possible but very difficult for South Africa to intervene and to disallow the shipment .

China is one of Zimbabwe 's main trade partners and allies .

Afriforum 's kallie kriel stated that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee had granted approval for the transit of the weapons on 14 April 2008 .

Kriel stated he had written to Committee Chairman and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi asking him to retract the permission .

Kriel stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory effectively means that the government is replacing its ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with a more catastrophic policy of complicity with the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against its own citizens .

The South African Government stated on April 4 , 2008 that the South African Government will probably not stop the arms shipment head to Zimbabwe .

A South African government spokesman stated on April 4 , 2008 that South Africa will not intervene to stop a shipment of Chinese @-@ made weapons from reaching Zimbabwe even though the political situation in Zimbabwe is dire .

The shipment is in a ship called the an Yue hiang which was anchored outside Durban harbor after receiving permission late on April 16 , 2008 to dock .

The shipment contains nearly 3 million rounds of ammunition for small arms and AK @-@ 47s , about 3500 mortars and mortar launchers and 1500 rockets for rocket @-@ propelled grenades .

This report comes from the Beeld newspaper which claimed to have a copy of the ship 's cargo documentation finalized on April 1 , 2008 which was 3 days after Zimbabwe 's election .

An anonymous government official confirmed that the shipment contained weapons but gave no further details .

Durban port authorities and police explosives inspectors could not be reached for comment .

The South African Revenue Service said customs officials were bound by confidentiality rules and could not give details of the content of the cargo .

Spokesman Themba Maseko stated as long as administrative papers are in order South Africa cannot intervene to prevent weapons being transported through South African territory to Zimbabwe .

Defense Secretary January Masilela confirmed to South African radio that the National Conventional Arms Control Committee granted approval for the transit of the weapons .

January Masilela stated that if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government , South Africa has nothing to do with the transaction because South Africa works according to established international conventions which allow the nation no jurisdiction over goods in transit .

Sydney Mufamadi is the government official who approved the transit and he is the same official who heads the team mediating in the Zimbabwe crisis .

Themba Maseko stated that the situation in Zimbabwe is dire because elections are held and results are not released 2 weeks after .

On April 17 , 2008 Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called on South Africa and President Thabo Mbeki to step aside as mediator for Zimbabwe in favor of Zambia 's president , who has taken a tougher stance toward Mugabe .

Afriforum stated that the group would organize protests along the route to Zimbabwe .

Kallie kriel of afriforum stated that the South African Government 's approval for the transport of the arms across South African territory will in effect mean that the Government is replacing an ineffective policy of silent diplomacy with an even more catastrophic policy of complicity to the State violence and human rights violations committed by the Zimbabwean government against Zimbabwean citizens .

The South African Revenue Service stated that the ship would be subject to standard inspection procedures and the cargo would not be released until ithe cargo was proved to be compliant to customs formalities .

The resolution requires all 192 United Nations Member States to adopt laws to prevent terrorists , black marketeers and other non @-@ State actors from manufacturing , acquiring or trafficking in nuclear , biological or chemical weapons or the materials to make them .

The resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on efforts to implement the resolution that was due in October 2004 .

The Security Council resolution calls on all States to fully implement a Security Council resolution adopted in 040400 requiring all 192 United Nation Member States to adopt laws to prevent non @-@ State actors from acquiring nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .

The Security Council resolution notes that some unnamed countries have not filed a report on the member nations efforts to adopt these laws .

International treaties targeted weapons proliferation by Governments until Resolution 1540 was adopted in 040000 there was no legal instrument to prevent terrorists , criminal scientists , black marketeers and other non @-@ State actors from obtaining weapons of mass destruction .

Resolution 1540 was introduced as the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a vast black market in nuclear equipment and technology .

The black market investigation was encouraged by Pakistan 's admission in 040200 that Pakistan 's leading nuclear scientist had passed technology to Iran , Libya and North Korea .

Resolution 1540 requires all countries to adopt laws to prevent non @-@ State actors from manufacturing , acquiring or trafficking in nuclear , biological or chemical weapons , the materials to make them , and the missiles and other systems to deliver them .

Resolution 1540 requires all countries to take measures to account for and secure these weapons , missiles and other weapons material .

Resolution 1540 also demands that countries develop border controls and step up law enforcement efforts to detect , deter , prevent and combat the illicit trafficking and brokering of weapons of mass destruction .

The resolution adopted on 080425 extends the Resolution 1540 Committee 's mandate until 110425 and again calls upon all States that have not yet presented a first report on steps the States have taken or intend to take to implement Resolution 1540 to submit such a report to the 1540 Committee without delay .

The 080425 resolution also calls on the Resolution 1540 Committee to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States by reaching out to countries , facilitating technical assistance , and promoting shared experience and lessons learned .

The Security Council stated that not all States have presented to the Resolution 1540 Committee the state 's national reports on implementation of Resolution 1540 and that the full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States is a long @-@ term task that will require continuous efforts at national , regional and international levels .

The Security Council stated that full implementation of Resolution 1540 by all States includes the adoption of national laws and measures to ensure implementation of the Resolution 1540 inspired national laws .

Dumisani Kumalo stated that many developing countries find the reporting requirements for Resolution 1540 and other resolutions onerous when they are trying to provide food , health care and jobs for the people of developing countries .

The 080425 resolution was approved on the day that Mohamed ElBaradei angrily criticized Israel for bombing an alleged Syrian nuclear facility , chastised the United States for withholding information on the alleged Syrian nuclear facility , and stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency would investigate the allegations of the Syrian nuclear facility .

A leading arms expert stated that China 's improved nuclear arsenal raises questions about the Chinese government 's future arms control efforts .

The expert praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons abroad .

A leading arms expert stated on 8 May 2008 that Chinese government is making dramatic improvements to China 's nuclear arsenal which raises questions for future arms control efforts .

Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Bates Gill spoke at a panel for journalists while on a visit to Beijing to promote an annual report on the global arms industry .

Recent upgrades have increased the accuracy and mobility of China 's arsenal while a switch from liquid to solid fuel has shortened reaction times .

China stands out due to the effort to modernize , expand and improve nuclear weapons capability .

Among the 5 nuclear Powers China is making the most dramatic improvements in nuclear force which raises arms control questions .

The Chinese Government stated China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and China 's arsenal , estimated at just over 100 nuclear @-@ armed missiles , is the smallest of the 5 main nuclear weapon Powers .

Chinese officials signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and gill stated the recent steps are aimed mainly at reducing the vulnerability of China 's deterrent force .

Gill stated the large increase in the military capability of China is targeted mostly at Taiwan but has the possibility going forward with force projection elsewhere .

Taiwan is a self @-@ governing island that China claims is part of China 's territory and has threatened to invade .

Gill stated that the increase in military capability complicates the issue of China as a player in the arms control agenda and that the Chinese government would need to be engaged in future efforts to cap or reduce numbers of nuclear weapons .

Gill praised Beijing officials for decreasing sales of weapons and military technology abroad which Gill believes was largely done out of a desire to be viewed as a more responsible player in international society .

Gill stated that authorities need to strengthen regulation to prevent weapons from entering conflict zones , particularly in Africa where Chinese arms are used by both government and rebel forces in Sudan 's Darfur region .

Retired People 's Liberation Army Colonel Teng jianqun spoke alongside Gill on the panel and stated that China has substantial restrictions on weapons sales abroad .

Teng conceded that some dealers violated the rules and were beyond the Government 's direct control .

Teng stated that further steps were being taken to boost awareness of the rules , partly through courses for government and defense industry leaders run by the foreign ministry @-@ sponsored China Arms Control and Disarmament Association of which Teng is Deputy Secretary @-@ General .

The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to its tightly controlled military and would overturn a ban on the military use of space .

On 13 May 2008 Japan 's powerful lower house of parliament voted to allow Japan 's space programs to be utilized for national defense .

The legislation is the most recent effort by Japan to ascribe more freedom to the tightly controlled military technically known as a self @-@ defense force .

The bill states that space programs must contribute to ensure peace and safety of international society as well as the national security of Japan .

Inclusion of the defense minister in decisions on space programs introduces the possibility for the military to possess and develop spy satellites .

The legislation would establish a special space task force led by the Prime Minister and create the new post of space development minister .

The nation 's largest newspaper Yomiuri approved of the bill and urged its quick enactment .

Some pacifist lawmakers from the Communist and Social Democratic parties boycotted the vote on 13 May 2008 stating that the bill contradicted the principle of a civilian @-@ controlled space program .

It is even more complicated in borderless cyber space where there is no smoking gun , fingerprints or footprints .

The agreement was signed during a regular meeting of Chiefs of Defense Staff from the 26 NATO allies .

Russia proposes cooperation with India and China to increase security around Afghanistan to block drug supplies .

Afghanistan is 1 of the world 's major opium producers and supplies Western markets through transit countries such as Russia .

On 15 May 2008 the Government of Russia proposed cooperation with India and China to increase security around Afghanistan in order to block drug supplies .

Lavrov 's intentions were not immediately clear since neither Russia nor India has a border with Afghanistan and China 's border with Afghanistan is only 76 kilometers ( 45 miles ) .

Afghanistan is 1 of the world 's major opium producers and supplies Western markets through transit countries such as Russia .

The Government of Russia states that thousands of Russians die from AIDS @-@ related illnesses each year due to abuse of Afghan @-@ sourced heroin with infected needles .

Last week drug police in Tajikistan announced their interception of the largest quantity of opium and heroin in Tajikistan 's history estimated to be worth approximately 10 million U.S. dollars ( 6.5 million euro ) .

Dmitry Medvedev promised to raise officers ' salaries .

Dmitry Medvedev was sworn in on May 7 , 2008 as the Russian Federation 's President and has so far portrayed an image of a liberal and avoided the harsh anti @-@ western rhetoric of Vladimir Putin .

Vladimir Putin was Dmitry Medvedev 's predecessor and mentor .

Most observers expect Dmitry Medvedev to continue the policies of Vladimir Putin , such as an assertive posture on the international scene and vow to strengthen the military .

Vladimir Putin fiercely opposed the United States ' plans to deploy missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic , and NATO 's plans to accept into the alliance Russia 's ex @-@ Soviet neighbors , Ukraine and Georgia .

Vladimir Putin has threatened to point nuclear missiles at countries that take part in U.S. missile defense and opted out of a key Soviet @-@ era arms control treaty .

Topol @-@ M missiles are capable of hitting targets more than 10000 kilometers or 6000 miles away .

Vladimir Putin and other officials have boasted about the Topol @-@ M 's ability to penetrate any prospective missile defense .

Yuri solomonov designed the missile and stated that the missile drops engines at a significantly lower altitude than earlier designs which makes it hard for an enemy 's early warning system to detect the launch .

Yuri solomonov stated that the missiles ' warhead and decoys closely resemble one another in flight , making it very difficult for a foe to select the real target from a multitude of false ones .

Large oil revenues in recent years have allowed the Government of the Russia Federation to buy weapons and fund the development of new missiles .

Soviet @-@ built nuclear submarines frequently need repairs and rarely leave the bases .

Expert states that Iranian missile launch photo was doctored to show failed 4 th missile launching .

20080710 director of the London @-@ based International Institute for Strategic Studies 's non @-@ proliferation program and former US State Department official Mark Fitzpatrick stated that an Iranian photograph showing a cluster of missile launches from a desert range was altered to add a 4 th missile .

Fitzpatrick stated that the photo was probably manipulated to obscure the failure of the 4 th missile in order to maintain the impact of Iran 's demonstration of power .

The image was described as depicting part of military maneuvers in which nine missiles were test fired , including an enhanced version of the Shahab @-@ 3 .

Iranian officials stated that the enhanced Shahab @-@ 3 missile has a range of 1250 miles and thus could reach Israel and the majority of the Middle East .

More than 40 nations , including Israel and Arab States , agreed Sunday to work for a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .

On 080713 43 nations agreed to work toward zone free of weapons of mass destruction in Middle East .

A final declaration from a summit launching the Union for the Mediterranean states that the members of the Union for the Mediterranean States will pursue a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction .

The Union for the Mediterranean States stated that the Union for the Mediterranean States member countries will consider practical steps to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .

Israel is widely believed to have a stockpile of nuclear weapons .

The Government of Israel 's official stated policy neither confirms nor denies if Israel possesses nuclear bombs .

The United States and the allies of the United States believe Iran is pursuing nuclear arms .

The Iranian government maintains that Iran 's uranium enrichment activities are for nuclear energy production .

The Iranian government has defied U.N. Security Council demands that Iran suspends the enrichment of uranium .

Russia suspended participation in the arms control treaty late last year because NATO countries had not ratified a revised version of the Treaty .

Russian prosecutors have sent the case against ANAR Godzhayev to court after charging Godzhayev with attempting to smuggle tantalum powder to Iran .

Godzhayev could be sentenced to 7 years in prison if convicted .

The Russian Prosecutor General 's Office stated on 17 July 2008 that the founder of a Russian company involved in trade with Iran has been charged with trying to smuggle a metal that can be used for weapons of mass destruction or delivery systems to the Islamic Republic .

Tantalum can be used in the production of chemical processing equipment , nuclear reactors and missile parts and is subject to export restrictions under Russian law .

Prosecutors have stated that Godzhayev lied about the contents of an outgoing shipment in customs documents after a business partner asked Godzhayev to send more than a ton of materials containing tantalum to Iran in July 2007 .

Godzhayev was detained after customs officials checked the shipment in a container on a boat due to leave for Iran .

Godzhayev is a citizen of Uzbekistan and could face trial soon .

Godzhayev could be sentenced to 7 years in prison if convicted .

Godzhayev and Godzhayev 's lawyers were not immediately available to comment .

The Russian government support Iran 's right to nuclear energy and is building Iran 's first nuclear power plant .

The Russian government has stated there is no evidence proving claims by the U.S. and other Western countries that the Iranian government is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .

Officials in Moscow are involved in international efforts to persuade the Iranian government to ease fears by abandoning uranium enrichment .

Russian and United States leaders have maintained cooperation in efforts to thwart the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .

A U.N. representative stated that the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan but that the chemicals needed to complete the conversion are being smuggled into Afghanistan from other countries .

The U.N. stated on 28 July 2008 that the international community should do more to stop chemicals used to convert opium to heroin from reaching Afghanistan and detailed increasing sophistication in Afghanistan 's drug trade .

Afghanistan 's representative for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime Christina Oguz stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside Afghanistan mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency @-@ plagued South and the East .

Oguz stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries .

Oguz stated the chemicals needed to make the heroin were being smuggled from China , South Korea , European countries , including Russia , and other parts of the world .

Oguz stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to Afghanistan for illicit goals and Afghanistan has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals .

Afghanistan does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside Afghanistan and are smuggled into Afghanistan .

More than 200 tons of the chemicals have been seized by Afghan authorities since 2006 but some 13000 tons were needed based on 2007 's opium production figures .

A former senior U.S. State Department counter @-@ narcotics official wrote in an article in the 27 July 2008 issue of New York Times magazine that narco @-@ corruption went to the top of the Afghan Government .

The official alleged Karzai was reluctant to move against big drug lords in Karzai 's political power base in the south of Afghanistan where most opium is produced .

Karzai has stated commitment to eliminating corruption and battling the drug trade .

Afghanistan 's counter @-@ narcotic police confiscated 1.2 metric tons ( 1.3 tons ) of opium during a raid in southern Afghanistan .

The multibillion @-@ dollar opium trade helps fund the Taliban @-@ led insurgency .

Estonia is hosting some Georgian websites to protect the websites from hackers .

Officials stated on August 26 , 2008 that Estonia is temporarily hosting the websites of Georgia 's Central Bank and Foreign Ministry as well as a Georgian English @-@ languages news portal in order to protect the websites from cyber attacks .

Estonian informatics center spokeswoman Katrin pargmae stated that hosting websites in different countries makes the websites more complicated and time @-@ consuming for hackers to disrupt .

Katrin pargmae did not comment on the Georgian attacks .

Estonia has previous experience coping with cyber attacks because Estonian government and private sector websites were targeted in May 2007 .

The May 2007 attacks were days after Estonia decided to relocate a Soviet war memorial and grave .

The relocation angered Estonia 's ethnic Russian minority and neighboring Russia .

Estonian officials did not accuse any country of mounting what the Estonian Government stated were highly organized and professional attacks .

The European Union 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a verdict to freeze the assets of multiple individuals and groups accused of funding terrorist organizations .

The European Union 's highest court on September 3 , 2008 overturned a 2001 decision by European Union governments to freeze the assets of a Saudi businessman and a Sweden @-@ based charity suspected of funding Al @-@ Qaida terror groups .

The ruling conflicts with a United Nations anti @-@ terror order obliging United Nations Member States to freeze assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups .

None of the groups have so far been officially removed from the blacklist because European Union Governments argue the court rulings do not oblige the European Union nations to remove the names from the list but only force the European Union to inform the individuals and groups on the list that the assets have been frozen .

Head of the Saudi @-@ based Muwafaq Foundation Yasin Al @-@ Qadi appealed against the European Union 's decision to freeze proprietary assets .

United States Treasury officials allege the Muwafaq Foundation is an al @-@ Qaida Front used to funnel millions of dollars and euros to al @-@ Qaida .

Al @-@ Barakaat International appealed the European Union 's decision to freeze 1 million Swedish kroner or 152247 United States dollars .

Lawyers for Al @-@ Barakaat International stated that the money was being used to fund aid programs for families in Somalia .

Thomas Olsson stated that the lawyers for Al @-@ Barakaat International would now examine ways of having the assets released to the Somali immigrants in Sweden who used the network to send funds to relatives in Somalia .

Thomas Olsson also stated that the lawyers for Al @-@ Barakaat International have to examine the judicial consequences of the verdict as the sanctions remain on a United Nations level .

The European Union 's highest court stated on September 3 , 2008 that the 27 @-@ nation European Union is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse .

The ruling stated that the lower European Union 's court judgment erred in law by stating that European Union courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the United Nations .

Other suspects and groups on an European Union terror blacklist have also won legal victories for similar reasons against being listed .

These suspects and groups have so far not had assets unfrozen or names removed from the European Union 's blacklist .

The European Union 's High Court had previously overturned an European Union decision to freeze the assets of the People 's Mujahadeen of Iran .

The European Union 's High Court recently overturned a decision to freeze the assets of an exiled Philippine rebel leader and the Netherlands @-@ based Al @-@ Aqsa Foundation because the leader and group were not informed why the assets were frozen which is a breach of EU law .

370 people have had assets frozen because of placement on a terrorist blacklist by the United Nations Security Council .

Brazil 's Strategic Affairs Minister Roberto mangabeira Unger stated Brazil 's new national defense plan calls for establishing partnerships with countries including Russia and France to build a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art weapons industry .

On September 9 , 2008 Swedish Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobsson dropped charges against the 3 Swedes arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism .

Swedish Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobsson stated on September 9 , 2008 that charges will not be pressed against the 3 Swedes arrested on suspicion of funding terrorism earlier in 2008 .

The charges are being dropped because Ronnie jaccobson cannot provide that the men had intended to send money to terrorist organizations .

The Swedes were accused of using the informal money transfer networks called hawalas to send funds to alleged terror groups in Somalia .

Defense lawyer Thomas Olsson stated it was very tragic and a failure for Swedish law and order that the client Thomas Olsson was representing had been kept in detention for such a long time despite the weak evidence against client .

2 of the men were held for more than 3 months before being released at the start of the summer of 2008 .

Both Norway and Sweden have been spared violent terror acts but authorities in both countries have voiced concern about terrorists or terror financiers operating out of Scandinavia .

In 2005 2 Iraqis were sentenced to prison in Sweden for collecting and transferring money to terrorist Abu Musab al @-@ Zarqawi .

Russian Federation plans to upgrade Russia 's nuclear deterrent and modernize the military in light of a recent war with Georgia .

President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered an upgrade of the Russian Federation 's nuclear deterrent and the modernization of Russian armed forces .

Medvedev also announced plans to begin large @-@ scale production of warships including nuclear @-@ powered submarines armed with cruise missiles .

The statement was posted on the Kremlin web site and carried by state news agencies .

Russian military responded to Georgia 's attack on the breakaway region of South Ossetia with force and defeated the Georgian army but the brief war highlighted Russia 's aging arsenal .

The Russian military must ensure superiority in the air , in carrying out precision strikes at land and sea targets and in the timely deployment of forces .

Medvedev did not mention the new borei @-@ class nuclear submarines which are designed to carry a new intercontinental missile that is seen as a key future component of Russia 's nuclear forces .

The Dutch Foreign Ministry said on 081020 that a Dutch government investigation has found that a Russian cluster bomb killed a television cameraman in Georgia in 070000 .

Dutchman Stan Storiman died during the conflict over the breakaway province of South Ossetia while filming the fighting in Gori , Georgia .

Akkermans was working with Storimans and suffered minor injuries .

The Dutch foreign ministry said a Dutch investigative team sent to the spot 2 weeks later to gather forensic evidence and eyewitness accounts concluded Storimans was killed by a munition propelled by a type of rocket that is only found in Russia 's military arsenal .

Verhagen said in a statement that Verhagen had made that clear to the Russian authorities cluster munitions must not be used in this way .

The Russian government denied using cluster munitions during its brief war with Georgia in 070800 .

Verhagen said the Netherlands Government plans to raise the matter with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe .

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe addresses arms control issues and includes both Russia and Georgia as members .

The Dutch Foreign Ministry said Dutch government representatives will call for a political statement to be issued in which Member States pledge not to use cluster weapons in situations of this kind .

Cluster bomblets have been criticized by human rights groups because they kill indiscriminately and because unexploded ordinance poses a threat to civilians similar to that of land mines .

More than 100 countries agreed in Dublin , Ireland , in 080500 to ban cluster bombs within 8 years .

This included a French @-@ Algerian former prison inmate who admitted establishing an Islamic group that called for armed Jihad in France .

Bourada was one of 36 Islamic militants convicted ten years ago for providing support for bombings that terrorized France in 1995 .

Bourada received a 10 @-@ year term , but won early release in 2003 under police surveillance .

Bourada will not be eligible for parole for at least 10 years under the October 23 , 2008 verdict .

Head of the counter @-@ terrorism unit of the National Police Christophe chaboud told the Associated Press in 2005 that the group had had indirect contacts with Iraq 's former al @-@ Qaida leader Abu Musab al @-@ Zarqawi .

The court ruled that group member Kaci ouarab had received weapons training in Lebanon in 2005 that was designed to help carry out bombings in France .

Ouarab was sentenced to nine years without the possibility of parole for at least six .

The Court considered ouarab to be the natural , legitimate and operational successor of Bourada .

Melliti was given eight years without the possibility of parole for at least two @-@ thirds of that term .

147 of the United Nations 's 192 member nations voted on 081031 to move ahead with crafting the proposed arms trade treaty .

The United States and Zimbabwe were bitter opponents in 080700 concerning the United States @-@ proposed sanctions on Zimbabwe 's leaders that were vetoed by Russia and China .

Proponents of the treaty regulating the global arms trade stated that they hope to craft and adopt a treaty within 3 to 5 years with the aim of imposing controls on an international arms trade that contributes to the killing of more than 1000 people a day .

The treaty regulating the global arms trade would apply only to arms sales among nations and not commercial sales involving individuals .

John Duncan stated that the treaty regulating the global arms trade has to be as universal as possible and that some the countries are arms manufacturers and that all nations are arms suppliers at one stage or another .

John Duncan stated that it is by closing loopholes that nations can stop arms distribution into the hands of criminals and terrorists .

The United States favors language contained in some of the negotiating documents about treaty regulating the global arms trade that require consensus decisions that essentially give the United States and other nations veto power .

That process included meetings from 071031 to 081031 among a group of experts that recommended items for consideration that included the consensus language .

The 081031 vote will move forward arms trade treaty discussions toward the specifics of the possible language of the arms trade treaty .

Christina Rocca stated that the United States does not believe a global arms trade treaty would accomplish the promotion of responsibility in arms transfers and the reduction of the destabilizing trade in illicit arms .

Christina Rocca stated that the only way to convince all major arms exporting countries to sign on to the arms trade treaty would be to weaken the arms trade treaty provisions and a weak arms trade treaty would legitimize an international standard based on a lowest common denominator that would not address the problem of illicit and irresponsible arms transfers .

A 081121 report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece , Turkey and Belarus have missed deadlines that were required under an international treaty to destroy their land mine stockpiles .

Diplomats from Greece , Turkey and Belarus declined to be interviewed about the report in Geneva .

The report quoted the Governments of Greece , Turkey and Belarus as acknowledging that the deadlines have been missed .

The 1155 @-@ page annual report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said Greece mentioned legal problems with contracting a company to carry out the destruction and the difficulty of finding environmentally safe destruction sites as reasons for the delay .

Turkey 's government claimed preparations for getting rid of Turkish stockpiles took longer than planned .

Belarus said there were delays in receiving support funds from the European Union .

Arms Control director of New York @-@ based Human Rights Watch Steve Goose said Greece , Turkey and Belarus will not face sanctions for missing their deadlines .

The report said only 500000 mines were destroyed worldwide over the past year but said Afghanistan , Burundi and Sudan got rid of all of stockpiles respectively .

The report said the number of destroyed stockpiled mines since the treaty to ban land mines came into force in 990000 has been brought to more than 42 million but that 44 countries still have 176 million mines .

An institute for public policy research report said there are 27 weak states that pose a threat to Britain 's national security as the States could provide bases for terrorists .

A report published on 27 November 2008 stated Britain is vulnerable to terrorists operating out of weak States where terrorists can run training camps and raise funds undetected .

The report was co @-@ authored by former NATO chief George Robertson and published by international think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research .

The report said there are 27 weak states that pose a threat to Britain 's national security as the States could provide bases for terrorists .

The countries include Haiti , Nigeria , Somalia and Yemen and have vulnerable Governments that are unwilling or unable to control the territories .

The report stated transnational terrorists have discovered that the global space is largely unregulated with the rule of law either weak or nonexistent and is a place where terrorists can operate with a reasonable prospect of impunity as in the mountains of Afghanistan before 9 @/@ 11 .

Kearns stated that these remote areas are impossible to patrol and any activity could go undetected .

The report stated British government must help to stabilize weak states and push for international regulations that would stop terrorists using freely available information to create and unleash new forms of biological warfare such as a modified version of the influenza virus .

Kearns stated the Government must take a multilateral approach to areas including biotechnology but that the government is not moving quickly enough on the approach .

Kearns stated the global financial crisis shows the results of not having multilateral frameworks in place to deal with international issues .

Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned that European transfer of European technology to the People 's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan .

Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu warned on 040212 that the transfer of European technology to the People 's Republic of China could encourage the PRC government to invade Taiwan .

Lu noted that the European Union adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland China after the Tiananmen massacre of 890000 and said it is worrisome that the leaders of France and Germany are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of commercial interest enticements by the PRC government .

Lu expressed concern that European advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the PRC government 's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of Taiwan by the mainland .

Lu said that the government of mainland China has tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against Taiwan .

Lu described the PRC government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at Taiwan and the PRC 's preparations to invade Taiwan .

Lu added that this is why Taiwanese President Chen Shui @-@ bian called for a peace referendum for 040320 alongside the Taiwanese presidential election .

Lu said that Taiwan is not a part of the People 's Republic of China and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan .

Taiwan has never ceased making efforts to participate in international activities and has made great contributions to global development despite being refused membership by many international organizations .

Lu 's remarks were made at Taiwan 's presidential office while receiving the mayor of the Austrian city of Innsbruck Hilde Zach .

Zach arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a 6 @-@ day visit at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

Zach hopes to gain a better understanding of Taiwan 's development in the political , economic , cultural and tourism fields .

Taiwan Executive Yuan may not approve Taiwanese participation in the construction of submarines sold from the United States .

A delegation of Taiwanese legislators completed an 11 @-@ day fact @-@ finding trip to the United States .

The Taiwan Executive Yuan submitted a NT $ 610.8 billion ( US $ 18.23 billion ) special budget to buy 388 Patriot PAC @-@ III missiles , 8 conventional submarines and 12 P @-@ 3 C anti @-@ submarine aircraft from the United States earlier this month .

The budget is now pending approval by the Legislative Yuan .

Ker Chien @-@ ming , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) whip at the Taiwan legislature said on 040628 that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the China Shipbuilding Corp. ( CSBC ) should take part in the construction of submarines which the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan .

Navy Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Miao Yung @-@ Ching called on the Legislative Yuan to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part .

Miao said it is not feasible for CSBC to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the Navy will negotiate with the United States on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers .

Miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines .

The United States has control of the key technology in building the submarines .

Lee said on 040628 that the delegation asked the United States to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from 15 years to 10 years .

This indicates that Taiwan has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself .

Lee said that if the submarines are not built by Taiwan then the cost of the eight subs will be NT $ 100 billion less than the original plan of NT $ 400 billion .

Lee answered that any possible naval military balance tilting toward the PRC after 050000 would not mean an eruption of war at that time .

Lee added that an order of Kidd @-@ class destroyers due to arrive at Taiwan by the end of next year would allow Taiwan to still maintain its edge .

Lee also said that the United States will deliver the first 5 of 12 P @-@ 3 C aircraft in 080000 , with another 3 in 090000 , 4 in 100000 and the final 4 in 110000 .

China 's military budget has grown in recent years leading some to believe that China is attempting to achieve global dominance .

Mainland Affairs Council Chairman and Taiwan 's top China policy planner Joseph Wu stated on March 4 , 2007 that China 's substantial military budget increase of 17.8 percent reveals an attempt at achieving global dominance .

Joseph Wu made his statement after China made public the Chinese draft budget bill for 2007 .

Joseph Wu stated that China is attempting to achieve global dominance because the significant budget increase , the lack of transparency in military buildup , the rapid expansion of air and naval forces , and progress in space defense technology suggests an attempt at global dominance .

Joseph Wu stated that China 's annual military spending has experienced double @-@ digit growth since 1993 .

Joseph Wu also stated that growth in China 's military expenditure is not expected to slow down in the foreseeable future but will instead accelerate and become a long @-@ term trend .

Joseph Wu stated that China 's continued military budget growth deserves global attention and concern because there is no apparent threat and no potential future threat to China 's security in sight .

Joseph Wu and Western military experts stated that China 's actual military budget is about 3 times the officially declared figure .

Joseph Wu stated that Taiwan 's plan to procure 3 expensive weaponry systems , 8 diesel @-@ electric submarines , 6 Patriot PAC III anti @-@ missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P @-@ 3 C anti @-@ submarine aircraft is aimed at strengthening the defense capability of Taiwan in light of China 's military buildup .

The Government approved an application by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to use 0.18 @-@ micro chip manufacturing technology at the wafer foundry in China .

The the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) approved lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries for Chinese investment .

On 8 April 2008 the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( moea ) announced approval for 4 Chinese investment proposals from Chinese manufacturers .

Lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries were approved for investment and will invest in integrated circuit packaging ( ICP ) and testing .

The companies will invest 10 million US dollars , 20 million US dollars , 6.7 million US dollars , and 50 million US dollars respectively .

The Investment Commission 's Executive Secretary Fan Liang @-@ Tung stated the investment procedure aims to ensure Taiwan 's investments in China will not harm Taiwan 's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland .

Under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 100 million US dollars , the company 's total investment in China reaches 200 million US dollars , or the investment could transfer core local industries ' technologies to China .

Fan stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 8 @-@ inch wafers and 4 @-@ inch TFT panels as well as IC packaging .

After the meeting on 8 April 2008 the Commission requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company 's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan , information on any technology transfers and the company 's domestic investment as well as employment information .

Fan stated lingsen precision industries , King yuan electronics , IC Assembly company Sigurd Corp. and Siliconware precision industries have made commitments to return capital to Taiwan in the amounts of 2 billion NT dollars , 19.2 billion NT dollars , 3 billion NT dollars and 23 billion NT dollars respectively by 2011 .

Fan stated the Commission will ensure the commitments are upheld once the investments are under way .

Fan stated the procedure would push Chinese investment from Taiwan to focus on down scale manufacturers rather than technology @-@ concentrated makers in a bid to keep high @-@ end technologies in Taiwan .

Fan stated the Commission will hold a 2 nd round of meetings to decide if the proposals will take effect and that the final decision will be made by 30 April 2008 .

The process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched in Bonn , Germany , when foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met to discuss what form further talks should take .

The long process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled Balkans was formally launched on 951218 in Bonn , Germany .

Foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met in Bonn to discuss what form further talks should take .

German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in opening remarks at the one @-@ day meeting that there can be no peace in the former Yugoslavia if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up .

The Croation delegation threatened to pull out of arms @-@ reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future .

Delegates from other countries called on Croatia , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and Serbia to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise .

Michael Williams is a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and formerly the United Nations ' senior spokesman for Croatia and called the early threats from Croatia and Serbia a worrying development and an ominous development .

Williams said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way .

This corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 951218 Bonn meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory .

Greek Foreign Minister karelos Papoulias observed of the Balkan belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking .

Papoulias said the Greek government is not as optimistic as other European partners and that just because there is a Conference does n't mean there is friendship between the people of the former Yugoslavia .

The agenda on 951218 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks .

Croatia , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and Serbia are the nations that signed the Dayton accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles , heavy artillery pieces , combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase .

This data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on .

Kinkel said that on 951218 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 960104 or 960107 in Vienna .

Kinkel said minor problems not substantive discord kept delegates from choosing a firm date .

Records show that on 20 April 1999 the kuwolsan made detours to 2 Thai ports to pick up 14000 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan 's destination .

The kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an Indian company after a deal to sell the sugar to Algerians failed .

An Indian investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 200 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy .

Indian customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to Kandla .

The kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for Pakistan .

Irregularities in the kuwolsan 's papers were apparent within the first few hours of investigation .

Indian officials questioned why anyone in Malta would choose to buy water refining equipment from North Korea when Malta is a short flight from Europe .

Indian customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan Tae Min Hun .

Tae blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if Indian officials did not allow Tae to leave Kandla .

On 30 June 1999 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan 's cargo boxes and Tae stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from North Korean officials .

Tae received instructions from officials in Pyongyang to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs .

The official Indian after @-@ action report stated Tae would not open any more boxes as per the telex .

The report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers .

According to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter , tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews ' bodies .

The official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside .

On 1 July 1999 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan .

Rocket nose cones , stacks of metal pipe and heavy @-@ duty presses used for milling high @-@ grade steel .

A Plate @-@ bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets , toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile , and Theodolites that measure missile trajectories .

A technical committee of Indian missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile @-@ making capability .

Some of the packets were labeled in English as Scud B or Scud C. Nearly all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in Korean .

Native Korean speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by North Korean scientists to replace scientific terms in Russian or Chinese .

The Scud B and Scud C designs found on the kuwolsan were from older North Korean missile programs which were derived from Soviet missile designs of the 1950 s .

One Indian government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional .

Retired director of the State Department 's Office on strategic , proliferation and military issues in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research Greg Thielmann stated the CIA utilized the blueprints to make full mock @-@ ups of missiles complete with decals .

The blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of North Korea 's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the United States and North Korea since the 1980 s .

The cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments .

Missile expert and senior analyst at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies Timothy V. McCarthy examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from North Korea to Libya .

McCarthy stated the intelligence find helps U.S. officials learn how North Korean missile scientists learn .

McCarthy stated the information gives U.S. officials an idea of how capable North Korean scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives U.S. officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country 's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country 's officials .

McCarthy stated no one can stop Libyan scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles .

The kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after Indian officials released the kuwolsan in 2000 .

Shipping experts at Lloyd 's maritime division in London stated the kuwolsan 's name was changed in the summer of 2000 to Sun grisan 9 .

As of the week of 3 August 2003 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the Somalian capital of Mogadishu .

The nature of the Sun grisan 9 's cargo was unknown .

As stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the United States and India the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of North Korea as the world 's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation .

In 1999 North Korean leader Kim Jong Il expelled U.N. inspectors , abandoned the Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty and declared plans to build an atomic weapon .

On 31 August 1998 North Korean officials launched a 3 @-@ stage missile which heightened fears of advanced North Korean designs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland .

The first stage splashed down in the Sea of Japan , the second stage crossed the main island of Japan and the third broke up and traveled 3450 miles downrange and fell into the Pacific Ocean .

North Korean officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that North Korean officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade .

North Korean officials have sold missiles and parts to Yemen which received 15 Scud missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by U.S. and Spanish naval crews off the Yemeni coast in December 1998 .

The kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak States , open borders , lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction .

Korea specialist with the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California Daniel pinkston stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans , data , and intellectual property are difficult to intercept .

China confirmed on January 23 , 2007 after 12 days of silence that China had fired a guided missile into space to destroy one of its satellites .

China confirmed on January 23 , 2007 after 12 days of silence that China had fired a guided missile into space to destroy one of its satellites .

Liu Jianchao stated that the use of anti @-@ satellite technology does not mean China has abandoned its long @-@ standing opposition to the military use of space .

Liu Jianchao said at a ministry briefing that the test was not targeted against any country and does not pose a threat to any country .

The Chinese test shot destroyed an overage weather satellite 537 miles above Earth and was detected by U.S. monitors January 11 , 2007 .

The Chinese government refused to discuss it .

Officials and analysts interpreted it as a signal that U.S. military satellites could be vulnerable to attack by China .

China 's newly demonstrated ability could threaten Taiwanese satellites monitoring Chinese short @- and medium @-@ range missile deployments along the Taiwan Strait .

U.S. officials were dismayed by the Chinese test because the United States and Russia have abstained from such tests after testing anti @-@ satellite technology in the 1980 s .

Liu declined to address questions on this danger .

China has started an accelerated military modernization program and has repeatedly stated its desire to be able to compete in 21 st @-@ century warfare .

The Chinese military runs China 's space program and has identified space @-@ based communications and sensing systems as key to such efforts .

Pinpoint weapons would be used to disrupt the more advanced and better @-@ equipped U.S. military .

Analysts believed that the January 11 , 2007 test was part of the military modernization program despite China 's frequent declarations that it wants to prevent an arms race in space .

Liu repeated the long @-@ standing Chinese position when asked about the appearance of a contradiction and said China will further promote de @-@ weaponization and the peaceful use of outer space .

China has consistently advocated at the United Nations for the peaceful development of space and pushed for an international agreement to prevent it from becoming the theater for a new arms race .

The United States has opposed China 's suggestion for an international conference to pursue such an accord and argued there is no need for it .

Liu was asked whether the anti @-@ satellite test violated the spirit of China 's proclaimed position and why China kept silent for nearly two weeks while officials around the world were discussing it on the basis of U.S. intelligence reports .

China made the response about the test quickly after the relevant parties expressed their concerns .

China stressed that opposition of weaponization and an arms race in outer space .

The interior ministry said Saudi police have arrested 10 men and accused them of collecting donations to fund terrorist acts outside the Kingdom .

A lawyer and a prominent dissident said that at least seven of the men were Saudi democracy activists whose arrest was a government attempt to abort their civic rights work .

The interior ministry said Saudi police have arrested 10 men and accused them of collecting donations to fund terrorist acts outside the Kingdom .

A lawyer and a prominent dissident said that at least seven of the men were Saudi democracy activists whose arrest was a government attempt to abort their civic rights work .

Matrouk al @-@ Faleh said the seven men had been waiting for government approval to set up a civic rights group .

Al @-@ Faleh was jailed in 2004 for calling for more democracy in the kingdom .

The men had planned to present authorities with a list of more than 40 prisoners without legal representation whom they intended to defend .

Al @-@ Faleh said the terrorist allegation is a cover @-@ up and that it was used to get al @-@ Faleh arrested .

Police went to the Jiddah beach house of lawyer Essam basrawi on Friday night and arrested basrawi and five other Saudi men .

Bassim Alim said Saudi businessman Abdul @-@ Aziz Al @-@ khereiji was arrested at a checkpoint as Al @-@ khereiji drove with his wife to Jiddah .

Basrawi 's Moroccan personal assistant also was detained .

An interior ministry spokesman told local newspapers that the arrested men had been involved in financing recruiters who sign up young Saudis to go into turbulent areas .

Many young Saudi radicals have crossed the long and porous border between the Kingdom and Iraq and joined up with Sunni Muslim insurgents there .

Alim said that the government 's accusations were baseless and that his clients were well @-@ known reformists with no connection to terrorism .

The men had been warned repeatedly by the government not to gather or write petitions because authorities feared the rise of a new political reform movement .

Alim said the men do not want any kind of organized reform movement .

The men are trying to stop any organized calls for reform .

Alim said police had illegally searched the men 's homes without warrants and seized files , books and computers .

Neither Alim nor family members have been allowed to see the arrested men .

Faleh did not know why they were not allowed lawyers or charged publicly or shown proof or evidence if they are guilty of the crime .

The arrests were the first to target democracy activists since reform @-@ minded King Abdullah took the throne in 2005 and pardoned Faleh and two other leading activists who had spent 18 months in prison .

A dozen other men arrested with them in March 2004 signed statements pledging to stop lobbying for political freedoms .

Faleh and the two others refused to sign and demanded legal representation and a public trial .

Legal Defense and public trials are allowed under Saudi law but rarely applied .

Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy and has a consultative council appointed by the government .

The Kingdom continues to show little tolerance for political opposition despite slow progression toward reform from Abdullah .

It imposes strict limits on freedom of expression and bans public gatherings and political parties .

Sulaiman Al @-@ Rushoodi is a lawyer and former judge who had been among the group of activists detained in 2004 .

Al @-@ Rushoodi was released several weeks later after pledging to address his demands solely to authorities .

The Consultative Shura Council recently announced it was considering laws permitting the setting up of civic rights groups which are currently not allowed in the Kingdom .

Saudi Arabia has two Government @-@ appointed human rights committees but bans independent human and civil rights organizations .

China has built and launched a communications satellite for Nigeria .

Chinese officials stated on May 14 , 2007 that China had launched a Chinese manufactured communications satellite into orbit on behalf of Nigeria .

The Chinese officials also stated that the satellite will go into operation by the end of 2007 and is expected to last 15 years .

This launch marks the first time China has built a commercial satellite and put the satellite into orbit on contract for another country .

Some view the launch as another sign of China 's increasing skill in space technology and China 's determination to be among the world 's great powers seeking to utilize the reaches of outer space for benefits on earth .

China 's space program 's rapid progress has caused worries in the United States because the program is run by the military and China has been recently emphasizing space @-@ based information warfare .

China 's space agency sent 2 astronauts into orbit in October 2005 in the Agency 's second manned spaceflight .

The Chinese government on May 7 , 2007 adopted a 10 year plan for expanded space exploration .

The plan includes more manned flights as well as unmanned probes of the Moon and beyond .

Chinese officials stated that the launch of the nigcomsat @-@ 1 aboard a Long March 3 B rocket on May 14 , 2007 represented a commercial challenge .

Some saw the launch as a symbol of China 's broad network of economic relations with Africa .

The official New China News Agency stated that the satellite represents China 's wish to cooperate with developing countries in the peaceful use of outer space and to promote a closer relationship between China and African countries .

Nigeria 's managing director of the nigcomsat @-@ 1 project Hammed Rufai stated that the launch was a breakthrough in ending the exclusive reliance on oil because the satellite will help Nigeria move toward knowledge @-@ based industries .

The official New China News Agency stated that China secured the 311 million dollar contract in 2004 in a bidding process in which 21 other companies took part .

President of the Great Wall Industry Corporation Wang Haibo stated that the Nigerian contract puts China onto the short list of countries that can build , launch and maintain a satellite for other nations .

In the 1990 s China frequently launched satellites for other countries after the satellites were manufactured elsewhere and acquired a reputation for providing such services more cheaply than other launch @-@ capable countries .

China had been trying to establish commercial relations with oil @-@ producing nations such as Nigeria as the Chinese economy grows nearly 10 percent a year .

Some officials have stated that Nigeria hopes to sell communications bands to neighboring African countries .

June 4 , 2007 6 hooded gunmen entered the traditional all @-@ night wake and shot two people , killing both .

The gunmen had written Z 's on the victims ' backs before the left .

The killings show the scope of the violence and the tactics of psychological warfare behind it .

The new blood refers to a group of Gulf cartel operatives who have turned against the zetas as members of the organization bid to control trafficking routes and local drug markets .

Gruesome killings have become frequent during the war this year .

Four other people were killed in and around Veracruz that same day .

The body later was stolen from its crypt .

Business owner Roberto moguel Martinez was kidnapped by armed men on June 6 , 2007 after being released from a hospital .

Martinez had been recovering from wounds suffered in a May 31 , 2007 attack .

Martinez 's mother wrestled briefly with Martinez 's armed kidnappers on a street in the center of the city according to the Veracruz newspaper notiver .

Martinez has not been seen since .

19 members of the army were ordered on June 4 , 2007 to be imprisoned as suspects in the killing of three women and two children at a rural anti @-@ smuggling checkpoint in Sinaloa .

Military officials said they had failed to stop at the checkpoint .

The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials that stated there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran 's nuclear program and activities .

U.S. and European officials may impose a 4 th round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the issue of Iran 's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007 .

The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed limited copies of the IAEA report before a meeting on 11 September 2007 of the 35 members of the IAEA board .

The findings reflect an agency agreement on 21 August 2007 with Tehran that Iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 August 2007 .

The accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran 's nuclear program and activities .

Reuters quoted a senior U.N. official as stating the Iranian government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed .

The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of Iran 's present and future nuclear program .

Iranian officials on 30 August 2007 stated cooperation with the IAEA possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions .

Iran 's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to Tehran 's Fars news agency that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of Iran 's nuclear activities and that all of Iran 's nuclear materials have been audited .

Arms @-@ control experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire of the Washington @-@ based Institute for Science and International Security wrote in a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials would provide the IAEA access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify Iranian answers to the IAEA 's questions .

Independent experts stated Iran 's latest agreement with the IAEA which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the West 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb .

U.S. State Department spokesman for the Bush administration Tom Casey stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of Iran 's program Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program .

Casey stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community .

Most Western Nonproliferation Experts stated the Agreement on 21 August 2007 contained little that could dissuade policymakers in Washington , London , Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions .

Executive Director of nonpartisan Washington think tank the Arms Control Association Daryl G. Kimball stated the agreement does not address the problem that the Iranian government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material .

Kimball stated the Iranian government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made .

Iranian officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions .

The Security Council has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against Iran but the penalties have been limited from U.S. demands under Chinese and Russian pressure .

SOLTANIEH stated in an interview with state @-@ controlled Iranian television that the report and the measures taken make the intervention of any other international organization including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified .

Documents outlining the Israeli proposal to allow the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules were distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group .

The proposal may complicate the Bush administration 's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade .

Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to States that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules .

Countries including India , Israel and Pakistan that have not signed the nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake .

According to a letter from the Chairman of the NSG on 17 March 2007 the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of the NSG 's debate over Indian officials ' bid for an exemption .

Among the nations that have not signed the Treaty only India and Israel would qualify for admission to the NSG under the Israeli proposal .

1 criterion indicated Israel 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a State should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if the State applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the State 's territory .

The documents circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials .

Israel 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption .

Despite ties between Israeli and U.S. governments the Bush Administration rejected the Israeli proposal .

The proposal may complicate the Bush administration 's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade .

President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the Pact as an important part of the Bush administration 's foreign policy legacy .

The deal is controversial in India and Congress must give approval .

State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated the U.S. government views the India deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including Israel .

Spokesman for the Israeli embassy David Siegel stated the suggestion that the Israeli government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the India debate is grossly inaccurate .

The Israeli government has never asked the NSG for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any Israeli @-@ specific request of the NSG .

Israel is recognized as a full @-@ fledged adherent to the NSG Guidelines .

The Israeli government has urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic , multi @-@ tiered , criteria @-@ based approach towards nuclear technology transfers .

If modification of the NSG Guidelines were to take place along the lines proposed by Israeli officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced .

Iran refuses commitment to halt expansion but hints a possible future halt .

20080726 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of mashbad that Iran had expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000 .

The statement was ahmadinejad 's first asserting an expansion since the 20080400 announcement that Iran was approaching the implementation of 6000 centrifuges .

An Iranian news agency reported that ahmadinejad stated Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the Internet .

A Western diplomat in Tehran speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that ahmadinejad 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West .

Arms control expert Jeffrey G. Lewis of the new America Foundation think tank stated that the Foundation was aware of Iran 's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the operational status of the machines is unknown .

Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims to produce only electricity because nuclear weapon production contradicts Islamic principles .

The US , Israel , Europe and the majority of Western arms control experts believe that Iran is pursuing the capability to produce bombs immediately in the event of a decision .

Ahmadinejad stated that after Iran resisted the West 's demands for a halt in nuclear activities , the West still pursued the resumption of negotiations .

A 6 @-@ week pre @-@ negotiation ' freeze for freeze ' period during which Iran would add no centrifuges and the West would refrain from promoting a 4 th round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council .

US officials repeatedly stated that no negotiations can begin before Iran verifiably halts all enrichment @-@ related activities but the Bush administration recently agreed to the ' freeze for freeze ' proposal and dispatch burns to Geneva .

20080726 during talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns Iran refused to respond to Solana 's offers .

Solana , burns and European envoys set a deadline for Iran to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including prohibitions on selling Iran refined petroleum products vital to the country 's economy .

Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or to observe the deadline .

Ahmadinejad stated that the West had consented to the existing 5000 @-@ 6000 centrifuges in operation provided that the number did not increase .

5000 centrifuges can produce sufficient nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb if the material is highly enriched .

A diplomatic meeting in Paris concludes with no agreement on further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran 's facility in Natanz .

On 081114 diplomats stated to the media that American , European , Russian and Chinese officials at a meeting on 081113 in Paris did not reach agreement on further actions to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran 's facility in Natanz .

Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for a nuclear power plant or fissile material for atomic weapons .

Russia and China have close political and business ties with Iran and feel no domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of Iran .

The United States does not have close political and business ties with Iran and feels domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of Iran .

Moscow 's Interfax news agency quoted Russian diplomat Sergei ryabkov as stating that the parties struck no deal on sanctions against Iran at the 081113 meeting and that the Western countries are in favor of the sanctions against Iran while China and Russia did not support sanctions against Iran .

David Albright stated that Iran 's heavy @-@ water research reactor near Arak is making significant progress according to the satellite images and that in a year and a half the heavy @-@ water research reactor near Arak has progressed from building frames to a largely finished facility .

David Albright is a former arms inspector and Director of the Institute for Science and International Security that is based in Washington , D.C..

Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research .

The United States and its western allies suspect that Iran 's efforts to produce is a precursor to creating a nuclear @-@ weapons infrastructure .

The latest developments in Iran 's nuclear technology development show the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming foreign policy team of United States President @-@ elect Barack Obama when it takes on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons .

The administration of United States President George W. Bush in its last months in power has managed to synchronize United States policies with the European Union , British , French and German leaders , to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against Iran .

While diplomatic maneuvering is taking place Iran continues to work towards mastering nuclear and missile technology .

Some Israeli officials have stated their alarm about Iran 's test @-@ firing this week of a solid @-@ fuel , two @-@ stage rocket with a range of 1200 miles .

A high @-@ security Russian laboratory complex storing anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the mosenergo electric utility .

A large repository of anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high @-@ security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow is facing the threat of loosing electricity .

An official from the Moscow region 's mosenergo electric utility arrived recently at the Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment .

The Russian laboratory complex is a 90 @-@ building campus and served as the location for Russia 's secret biological weapons program in the Soviet era .

An incorrect headline in the newspaper Izvestia stated that deadly viruses from a Moscow regional depository threaten Moscow .

There are no viruses at the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk .

At the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the Soviet Union .

Both Russian and Western officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .

Russian and Western officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat .

General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency .

General Nikolai N. Urakov is the longtime director of the the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .

The State scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site .

General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology .

General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way .

General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries that have contributed about 6 million United States dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another 500000 United States dollars per year to pay the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology 's electric bills and arrears .

An American scientist who works closely with the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology stated that the Russian government was responsible for paying for the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology 's electric bills .

Western aid for conversion of General Nikolai N. Urakov 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in 970000 because it was learned that Iran had made offers to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise .

Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing .

American scientist Randall Lee Beatty is working on the conversion of the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk .

Beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is a crisis .

The International Science and Technology Center finances approximately half of General Nikolai N. Urakov 's budget to support about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians .

Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months .

Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility .

Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air @-@ handling systems that all depend on electricity to function .

A biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies named Raymond zilinskas stated that the main threat from cutting power to the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape .

Raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus 70 degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead .

The confrontation between the mosenergo electric utility and the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self @-@ sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science .

Armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on .

In most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored .

Often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses .

Brazil to implement law allowing air force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace .

Brazil announced that the air force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace .

Prior to the policy taking effect late 20041000 a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans .

The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the US government and companies to lawsuits .

20010400 the United States reduced previous support for operations targeting drug @-@ running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an American missionary and her child .

Relatives of the victims sued the US government and won a settlement due to the Government 's provision of intelligence and technical support to the operation .

The US agrees with the Brazilian assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is both very serious and increasing .

The US government has consulted the Brazilian Government about the provisions of US law .

Brazilian officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the US before going into effect .

The US is scheduled to provide 10.2 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004 .

Gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug @-@ smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields .

Rio de Janeiro drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close .

The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security .

Some pilots of drug @-@ running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots .

The daily newspaper O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 20040718 @-@ 20040824 -- the extreme measure raises ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefits .

The penalty will be applied extrajudicially by administrative decision of the Commander of the Air Force .

Illegal Flights initially declined 30 percent due to trafficker 's concerns about improved tracking capabilities but subsequently reaccelerated .

Brazil 's northern Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used for smuggling arms , gold and diamonds .

The Venezuelan president 's weapons deals with Russia , curbs on military cooperation with the United States , and his plans to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible invasion by superpowers have the US and his domestic critics worried .

Leftists have been elected to lead Brazil , Argentina , Chile , Uruguay , Ecuador and Venezuela .

Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said that Venezuelans never ask what the US Marines are doing .

Espinoza said Venezuelans have to do whatever is necessary to protect Venezuela .

Campos said Venezuelans want the world to know that Venezuelans are not preparing to attack anyone and that the mission is to protect Venezuela .

The Government of Venezuela also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters , 10 Spanish transport planes , and 6 Spanish naval craft .

Venezuelan officials say the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes .

The implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas .

Espinoza said the reserves are not to be used as shock troops for any political party and that if there were a civil war , it would be up to each person to take their own side .

Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over 20 weekends in the second half of 050000 and could train 300000 more in 060000 .

Quintero said that Venezuelans do n't want to be the colony of any empire and have to be ready for any possibility .

100000 reservists in 050600 engaged with the Venezuelan navy in a massive war game to repel a stronger country that had invaded .

Asymmetrical warfare is a term coined by US military strategists to describe a conflict between unequal combatants where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics .

The US government has given $ 3.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia in the past 5 years .

A senior US official in an interview dismissed the notion that the United States Government wants to invade Venezuela as complete and utter nonsense .

5 US military trainers and students participating in an exchange program were ordered to leave the country in 050400 .

The North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 .

Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill stated on 18 June 2007 that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down a plutonium producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the Unit by December 2007 .

Hill stated stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 and 17 June 2007 when Pyongyang officials invited inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit for talks on verifying and monitoring a shutdown .

Following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei Hill stated the shutdown has long been anticipated .

Hill stated the shutdown could occur in a matter of weeks not months .

The Associated Press reported from Vienna , Austria that the IAEA stated on 18 June 2007 that a team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown .

North Korean officials refused to proceed with a February 2007 agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor until funds worth 25 million dollars in accounts linked to North Korea held in a Macao Bank were transferred to North Korea .

The funds were wired on 14 June 2007 to the New York Federal Reserve Bank after months of disagreement over the method of returning the funds .

The funds were to be sent to Russia 's Central Bank before a transfer to an account controlled by the North Korea government in a Russian commercial bank .

Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50000 @-@ ton shipment of fuel oil .

North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950000 tons of fuel oil in the next phase of the Agreement .

On 27 August 2007 Iran and the U.N .' s International Atomic Energy Agency released a plan for resolving issues by December 2007 .

Iran will not succumb to international pressure to curb Iran 's nuclear projects .

The United States and some European nations believe that Iran 's nuclear projects are for the purpose of making nuclear weapons .

Several Western Governments and leading arms control experts stated that Iran is attempting to avoid further punishment by the U.N. Security Council .

The International Atomic Energy Agency has no access to people , documents , sites .

The International Atomic Energy Agency loses the right to ask further questions in the future .

The International Atomic Energy Agency may have been tricked because it was eager for a deal .

Iran resolved questions about Iran 's past experiments with plutonium with no explanation how .

The International Atomic Energy Agency plan could leave the International Atomic Energy Agency with incomplete and misleading answers from Iran .

A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied purchases of nuclear @-@ related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 because of suspicions the purchases could have been used for building bombs .

A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied purchases of nuclear @-@ related materials approximately 75 times since 1998 because of suspicions the purchases could have been used for building bombs .

The 45 @-@ nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed to military use .

According to the Nuclear Suppliers Group 's mission statement countries act on an individual basis to block trades that violate export controls devised to maintain international cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .

The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond notifying companies of violating the group 's guidelines .

The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps data private and meets largely in secret .

Most of the denials of purchase have occurred since 2002 and have resulted from interventions by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group .

The list of trade denials was made available by a diplomat from a country interested in exposing the extent of Iranian efforts to acquire so @-@ called dual @-@ use items that can be converted to weapons production .

The list was made available on condition that neither the diplomat nor the diplomat 's country be identified .

The list names companies from Australia , Finland , Sweden , the United Arab Emirates and Iran that were prevented from carrying out deals because the items being sold were suspected of being militarily useful .

The listed items being offered for sale in the blocked deals included Nickel powder , petrochemical plant components , compressors , furnaces , steel flanges and fittings , electron microscopes , radiometric ore @-@ sorting machines , valves and tubing , lasers , a rotary drilling rig , a mass spectrometer and a nitrogen production plant .

The Iranian end users included the Government of Iran and Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , power companies , engineering , petrochemical and oil @-@ refining and gas companies , aircraft industries , schools , universities , engine manufacturers , mineral research centers , a helicopter support company and a plasma physics center .

Western diplomats stated that the government in Tehran uses front companies to receive and convert technology to weapons production without being detected as the standoff with Iran over Iran 's nuclear program has continued .

Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group .

The conflict is a test of Russia 's power and military reach .

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice demanded Russia withdraw its forces .

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili accused Russia of a well @-@ planned invasion .

Russia 's military incursion into Georgia indicates Russia 's confidence and resolve .

Russia 's military incursion provided a test of the capacities of the Russian military .

Putin attempted to modernize and re @-@ equip the Russian military during his 2 presidential terms .

Earlier in 2008 Russia announced it was broadly expanding support for the separatist regions .

Throughout 8 August 2008 reports conflicted about whether Georgian or Russian forces had won control of Tskhinvali .

Late on 8 August 2008 it was unclear whether ground combat had taken place between Russian and Georgian soldiers or had been limited to fighting between separatists and Georgian forces .

Iranian News Agency Fars stated that hackers known as group XP defaced or blocked 100 s of Shiite @-@ related websites .

The official website of Iraq 's Shiite religious leader the Grand Ayatollah Ali al @-@ Sistani was defaced and blocked in a sectarian @-@ motivated cyber attack on Shiite @-@ related sites .

It was not clear whether the attack began on 18 September 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008 .

Another website related to 1 of Al @-@ Sistani 's religious organizations , www.al @-@ shia.com , was also affected .

Iranian News Agency Fars stated that group XP had blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite @-@ related sites on 18 September 2008 and 19 September 2008 .

Neither the hacking claim nor an Iranian assertion that group XP was based in the United Arab Emirates could be verified independently .

Several Iranian news sites stated on 19 September 2008 that many of the Shiite and Iran @-@ related web sites that had been attacked were running normally again .

A statement signed group XP was posted on the home page of Al @-@ Sistani 's web site and stated that the attack was on behalf of Sunni Muslims .

Group XP had carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq .

Group XP erased the site as group XP has done with other Rafidha sites .

Rafidha means rejecters and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites .

Al @-@ Sistani promoted sexual deviance and an Iranian agenda in Iraq as Al @-@ Sistani was born in Iran .

The ayatollah 's office in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attack .

Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release .

Questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to Kenya and of a possible clandestine arms deal between Kenya and South Sudan .

On 08 October 2008 Maritime officials and associates of the Somali pirates who on 25 September 2008 hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom .

A businessman in xarardheere , Somalia named Ahmed Omar stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars and the ship may be freed on 08 October 2008 or 09 October 2008 .

One such detail involves the pirates ' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of American warships currently encircling them .

A Kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect .

The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced their request to 20 million U.S. dollars .

The pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures .

More than 25 ships have been hijacked in 2008 off the Somalia coast with a typical ransom of between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars .

The pirates aboard the Ukrainian ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in American dollars and preferably in 100 dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the 20 sailors on board will be released .

Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008 the Kenyan government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for Kenya 's military .

The deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone .

Ukrainian officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing .

Ukraine does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the Government of South Sudan .

Ukraine inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a major arms dealer .

The deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious given that Kenya has mostly relied on the United Kingdom and other western countries for its supply of heavy weapons .

Kenyan politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation .

Southern Sudan is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses Soviet @-@ designed tanks .

The American military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to Islamist insurgents in Somalia .

The pirates have denied interest in the weapons and claimed to have been unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship .

Pirate spokesman sugule Ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates ' sole interest in the deal is money .

Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .

Head of the U.N. drug office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban are cutting back poppy cultivation and stockpiling raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing for the insurgency .

Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan 's opium crop .

The survey showed that poppy cultivation had retreated in much of Afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong , most of those in the south .

The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintained a strong presence in 5 provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation as a way to finance their insurgency for several years .

Costa said the surplus is as much as 11000 tons , or more than twice world demand in the last 3 years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles .

The Taliban this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy .

The South African government imposed a ban that prohibits the recruitment of people inside or outside of South Africa for mercenary or foreign military assistance .

On 011006 The Citizen newspaper stated that it is illegal for South Africans to be involved in mercenary activity or to render foreign military assistance inside or outside of South Africa .

The Citizen newspaper stated that the South African Foreign Ministry announced on 011005 that the South African government imposed the mercenary activity ban following reports that 1000 Muslims with military training have enlisted to leave South Africa for Afghanistan to fight for the Taliban against the United States .

A report claims that Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders has claimed that the 1000 Muslim men with military training have volunteered their services and have received the backing of local businessmen .

South Africa 's Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa 's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits the recruitment of people inside or outside of South Africa for mercenary or foreign military assistance .

South Africa 's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that no person is allowed to offer military assistance to any State , organ of State , group or other country , unless permission is granted by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee .

South Africa 's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that foreign military assistance could be rendered only in accordance with an agreement approved by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee .

The South African Foreign Ministry stated that any person found in violation of South Africa 's Foreign Military Assistance Act or any person that fails to receive permission to participate in foreign military activities could be prosecuted and sentenced to a fine , imprisonment or both .

Former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos convicted of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service during ex @-@ President Fujimori 's tenure .

Montesinos plans to appeal the sentence .

On 1 July 2002 former Peruvian spy chief during the government of ex @-@ president Alberto Fujimori , Vladimiro Montesinos , was convicted of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service when Montesinos was supposed to be only an adviser to the spy agency .

A leaked videotape showed Montesinos bribing a congressman to switch to the government party and triggered events that culminated in Fujimori 's resignation in November 2000 .

Fujimori is accused of dereliction of duty and embezzlement and has been in self @-@ imposed exile in Japan since resigning to avoid the legal action from the Peruvian authorities under the protection of dual nationality .

Montesinos fled Peru in October 2000 but was captured in Venezuela on 23 June 2001 .

Montesinos heard the sentence at the Callao Naval Base where Montesinos has been imprisoned since 2001 .

Montesinos stated Montesinos would consult with a defense lawyer to appeal .

Hong Kong police making efforts to prevent triads or transnational criminal syndicates to engage in criminal activities

Recently , the Hong Kong police have smashed a transnational theft syndicate , a cross @-@ boundary criminal syndicate and a local triad gang specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes .

The Oriental Daily News opined that the recent Hong Kong police efforts to cut down 5 of the so @-@ called Triad branch leaders or district team leaders within a short 3 @-@ week period demonstrates the police 's determination to eradicate criminal activities .
