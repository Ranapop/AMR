# sentence: In reality humans contribute about 5 % to global worming in terms of CO2 release into the atmosphere . Yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can , but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming . It is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 years . Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused . The problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution . They have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect .

# sentence: I was working on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while I enjoyed the incoherent rambling argument on whether there is a god or not Im feeling kind of empty . The universe is the way it is because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte is a god or not . And trying to justify the existence of god through anything dealing with relativity is laughable . God is only able to exist through faith . And faith goes against everything that science stands for .

# sentence: My own conclusion is that terms like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " events " in the single universe . I am saying that the occurence of " life " is not an " event " in the usual sense because events presuppose " observers " who classify them as such . ( Observation in " our minds eye " is cognitive sleight of hand ) Note also the term " multi " implies " one who classifies or counts " and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?

# sentence: Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni @- you 're definitely not alone there . But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . It does n't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support @- labels are n't as important as your experiences . Meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . But yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere @- but do n't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse @- be kind to yourself and get some help .

# sentence: The situation in Iran has the ability to cause a lot of misery in the middle east but again , Iranian leaders are really quite self aware , they know what they are doing , and there is near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapons of them actually using them , although we as simple peasants obviously need to believe that and go along with our governments because if Iran does become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can n't be tolerated .

Let 's start bombing civilian areas , it just does n't matter apparantly And of course , I do n't condone either group , afterall , the IRA 's aims were only achieved after they laid down their arms .

# sentence: Must have something to do with providing people with gods to worship and adore in an age in which gods have been killed . By doing so , I guess , many people are saved from nihilism as a result of the loss of values from the death of God . Thus , superstars and rockstars are put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like . If we were living in ancient Rome , for example , the superstars and rockstars would be the heroic gladiators , but the best gladiators were often thought of as gods in their own right . They were supposedly treated like gods . Ceasar himself was worshipped as a god by the people . The gods of yestreday are the stars of today . When charles Atlas became famous they were saying he was a god . Great individuals are sometimes regarded as more than human by their fans . Fred Astair , Al Jolson , Charlie Chaplin , James Dean , Marlon Brando , Elvis , Sinatra , Bruce Lee , Bowie , Morrissey , boy bands like Take That , Lady Gaga and the like .

# sentence: The real question is why they can get away with it . And here @-@ well , I hate to keep saying this , but somebody needs to . The reason they can do it is because we still have NO INTEL on them . It 's the biggest failure of the war , and nobody talks about it . CI warfare is about people , not hardware . We 're all hardware and no intelligence , like a Tim Allen show . Makes me sick .

# sentence: That makes the decision to go with IEDs a no @-@ brainer for the insurgents . In the standard ambush , the kind we were facing a year ago , the insurgents detonated an IED under a convoy , then opened up on the stalled survivors with RPG and small arms fire . It probably made them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire was ineffective and by concentrating their forces , the insurgents made themselves vulnerable to our air power .

# sentence: An IED ambush has none of those risks . Only one man needs to be on the spot @-@ the triggerman . He detonates the IED from a car parked down a side street and drives away before the occupiers can even start their search . No risk . No casualties . Very demoralizing for the occupiers , especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood was in on the attack but they can n't level the locals ' shacks like they 're dying to .

# sentence: The scariest tech development of all is that the insurgents have learned how to make shaped @-@ charged IEDs . To understand why shaped charges are such a powerful weapon , we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physics . I love this stuff . I mean , what red @-@ blooded American boy did n't experiment with explosives ? The only reason I ever opened my Chem book was to see if it mentioned TNT or dynamite in the index . ( It did n't @-@ goddamn hippie teachers.) And naturally I used the local wildlife , like toads and bees , in my experiments with the killing power of firecrackers .

# sentence: Now before you hotheads whose hobby is making pipe bombs in the garage write me angry letters ( or send me long round packages with no return address ) , I know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast . We had a really nasty example of that in August this year , when a huge IED killed 14 Marines near Haditha . From what I 've read , investigation showed there was nothing special about the IED . It was just three anti @-@ tank mines stacked in a pile @-@ the IHOP of IEDs , I guess you could call it .

The same unit that suffered the IED attack had just had six of its snipers killed in a small @-@ arms ambush . Now you tell me how anybody can ambush six snipers unless they 've completely penetrated the unit . The insurgents knew where the unit 's snipers would assemble , and they knew where the vehicle would be passing . We do n't know a thing about the enemy , but it 's clear that he knows way too much about us .

# sentence: The other problem is that the 14 Marines were riding in one of those ridiculous landing crafts the Corps uses as APCs @-@ in Haditha , hundreds of clicks from the sea ! It 's called the AAV @-@ 7A1 , and it looks like a giant armored dinghy . Since it was designed to ferry troops ashore , it sacrifices armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that has no use anymore . But that 's the Corps for you . Real brave , but not always real smart .

# sentence: Sometimes an insurgency has to learn its lessons several times . Take the case of pressure @-@ triggered IEDs . These are basically standard anti @-@ vehicle mines , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . People and cars can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( meaning armored ) vehicle rolls over that scale , the bomb goes off . ( Trucks are a problem . Some trucks weigh as much as an APC.) The best part is that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . You can all be off at the hookah parlor polishing up your alibis when it goes off .

# sentence: The M1 is a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgents have managed to knock out . As usual , the invasion was the easy part and the occupation was when things got lethal . We only lost 18 M1s in the conventional fighting , but the guerrillas have since managed to disable 80. Now most of those are track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action .

# sentence: So if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal is to find a way to kill M1s . Not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . And that 's where the shaped @-@ charge IED comes in . Shaped charges were developed for tank killing , used in MBT anti @-@ armor rounds and antitank weapons . Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal . Metals with low melting points , usually copper . The bomb @-@ maker 's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible . So sometimes he 'll put several 155 mm shells beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of TNT under it .

# sentence: 7. He complains about intel , but then advocates harsh techniques that run contrary to the values of the US and does n't weigh the impact that these techniques would have on gaining intel from the population and @/@ or bringing the population off the fence and to our side . His recommendations would result is less intelligence - gaining some information from a paid triggerman may result in a few short @-@ term successes within a particular cell , but it will alienate the population and result is less intel over the long @-@ run from the population and future cells that would be created down the road due the increased perception of occupation through the harsh techniques he advocates . As an example , Abu Ghraib , which was the direct result of a half @-@ dozen irresponsible individuals that were able to conduct their abuses due to the lacking leadership of their supervisors , had a huge negative impact on our relations with local Iraqis . The trust we had built with many was eroded and our ability to gain trust with others was much more challenging .

# sentence: Bottomline , he does n't truly analyze the situation from all aspects and uses some faulty assumptions and some facts that are flat out wrong . In the end , you have the action @-@ reaction @-@ counteraction cycle that is producing bigger IEDs that are easier to catch , but more deadly if you do n't catch it . I 'm not stating that it 's not a problem , but this analysis does n't offer much value .

# sentence: I hope this helps . As far approaches to COIN , I 'm sure that Ray , Lemontree , Dave Angel , and some of the others on this board whose militaries have been doing COIN for much longer than the US ( which , BTW has done COIN quite frequently , but then shuns it as a freak occurance and does n't internalize the lessons learned in favor on focusing on the " big threat ") can comment at length on why this article espouses the wrong approach to the problem .
