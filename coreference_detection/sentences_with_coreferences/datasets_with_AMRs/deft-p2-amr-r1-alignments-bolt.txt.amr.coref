# sentence: Early in the morning on September 1 , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise . At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) . As a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life @-@ saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots . Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .

# sentence: It seems that all Chinese hate Japanese , and I am not an exception . However , has everybody thought it over that it was Russia who stirred up the war between China and Japan for fear that China would reclaim territories from it ? It was also Russia that went between the Communist Party and the KMT and was able to achieve success one way or the other . And at the end of the war of resistance , it then stirred up the civil war , and lured China to get involved in the Korean War . If Stalin was still alive , China would have more trouble !
