He can n't seem to help himself from apologizing for anything and everything .

He needs to conduct a beer summit between Palin and NBC .

Hell , sell tickets and hire the Chinese to cater the event .

I think Romney wins big today and obviously stays in .

Santorum gets enough of a boost to do the Huckabee hangs around .

I think Gingrich 's sole win in GA is enough to hang it up and go back to making millions in the private sector .

I think the Good Doctor is too crazy to hang it up .

My heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and I have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives .

If you have no problem with your tax dollars going to aid them then you 'd have no problem donating to them of your own free will .

Not to mention that he 's absolutely right that they should have insurance to cover them .

He 's right in some ways but it does n't translate into being right across the board .

This is n't like someone 's house burning down and they make an insurance claim .

Even if someone has insurance to cover their loss , that won't extend to the roads , power lines , sewers , public buildings .

Democrats get it , minorities get it , white republican jurisdictions do n't .

Is n't it interesting how Libertarians ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give ANYONE , ANYTHING .

So while libertarianism attracts people who want to be " free " it also attracts cheap assholes who do n't want to pay their fair share .

Perhaps when Libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two , I 'll vote for them .

How does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address ?

I know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town -- if you can find your damn pickup ! !

Homeowners generally have insurance , but Federal Aid is necessary to provide for the clean up , repairs of electrical and water systems , roads , schools , buses , etc. etc.

Keep in mind insurance companies are not in the business of paying claims , they are in the business of making money .

Anyone who suffers a loss as have those who lost everything over the weekend will not be made whole , and whatever claim they receive will not come soon or easy .

Ron Paul and his Libertarian ideas are at best impractical .

He had to win there to stay in , so ultimately this helps Mitt keep the vote split .

He 's a nonfactor at this point and only in out of spite .

When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?

If you cant feed , house and take care of a baby you have no business having one .

Why is it literally 100 % impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you do n't want government involved in something does n't mean you 're against it ?

I 'm in favor of feeding , clothing , and giving shelter to the poor . I 'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things .

Now am I just a genius who does n't know it , or is it really not THAT hard to understand such a simple concept ?

Will they try to prop Romney up with a strong VP to help make him more palatable - or will they bring in a new face ?

I do n't think Standtorum will tank , its going to be a close one till the very end , I am still rooting for a Romney @/@ McDonnell ticket .

Wow , another Solyndra @-@ type company who took our money and failed in their goal .

They laid off 125 employees , but gave big raises to executives .

Maybe because it would look bad for the guy who promises to pay their mortgages , put gas in their tanks , gave them free cell phones and increased the welfare rolls .

Of course , the people on the AIG bus tours likely did n't get soaked with high taxes to pay for this scam , so why should they care ?

This is not surprising or shocking to me .

Obama must pay off his supporters by way of cash infusions and call it " stimulus " money .

He is not lying to call it stimulus .

It stimulates others to be big contributors so they may be in on the next wave of free cash from the boy king .

The government will rush in and show these people that government dependency is better than working and providing for themselves .

No one should be expected to practice self sufficiency or concern themselves with personal responsibility .

If some on the left want to remain ignorant and not read Alinky 's book to prove it , that is on them .

I 've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things , but here 's a case where they did it the right way ,

they passed a bill , and Christie the Hutt decides he 's stull sucking up to be RomBot 's running mate .

Christie is being set up on this one and the legislature called his bluff

It will make him a big shot with the GOP in 2012 but by 2016 if he were to run for president " Christie vetoed gay marriage " will be a millstone around his neck .

Christies denial of marriage privleges to gays will alienate independents and his " I wanted to have the people vote on it " will ring hollow

When the situation was reversed Gingrich argued that Santorum was helping Romney get the nomination and for the good of the conservative cause Santorum should drop out .

Now that the same logic would apply to Gingrich dropping out , should he ?

I think Santorum is going to be the last of the " Not Romneys ", and Newt has had his moment .

Of course money is a problem for him so he may HAVE to drop out .

Santorum or Mitt . I could vote for either one .

He is , if nothing else , insuring that he 'll be able to sell books after the election .

I mean you do n't really think that any of these guys really give a shit about their party or their nation , do ya ?

Americans ' assessment of Congress has hit a new low , with 13 % saying they approve of the way Congress is handling its job .

In other words , Congress should stop all the politcal bickering , put their heads together and start working things out in a real bi @-@ partisan format .

Today on the Senate floor Durbin said healthcare premiums WILL NOT GO DOWN and that the Administration needs to quit saying that ! !!!

Then Nancy Pelosi in the House said we need to pass the Healthcare Bill so " we can find out what 's in it....."

If you force them to accept pre @-@ existing conditions and accept other insured 's currently not eligible because they cost too much , who is going to pay for that extra risk ?

Obama will hang them out to dry .

And we will have some very strategically located , large bases to counter Iranian and Russian agression for the next 50 years .

A good thing , but he will have to include things he opposes , like DRILLING and NUCLEAR power , along with coal power to get there .

what about when my favorite doctor quits because he is not going to take a pay cut ?

also , who is going to goto school for 15 years to be a doctor , with major student loans and only make a sub @-@ par government salary ?

i 'll tell ya what , if were going to goto school for 15 years , it would be for rocket science or computer engineering or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary .

last and most importantly , i never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who does not work because the government pays for them to live their life .

I plan on voting against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representatives .

Its as if the British Red Coats were in charge once again doing whatever is best for themselves irregardless of the consitution .

I say kick them all out of office , and then do it again every election for the next several cycles until they get the hint .

WE ARE NOT HAPPY , WE ARE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE ! !!!

I 'm not a Republican , I 'm not a democrat , I AM AN AMERICAN ! !!!!

Start respecting my country , my consitution , and our national heritage or get fired @/@ voted out .

Add your 2 cents people .

I 'll have a Senator to vote for along with my Representative , and Senator Voinovich is not running in 2010 so I 'll luckily have more options to vote for .

So far there are 3 candidates in the race that I 'm aware of , and I 'm not impressed by any of them .

As far as my Representative goes , I can n't wait to vote against him .

I vote ' for ' the best candidate for the job , regardless of political affiliation ( unless , of course , they are un @-@ American , like Libtards and Neocons ) .

Since none of the incumbents in my district will get my vote , I guess you could say I 'm voting ' against ' them , but I 'm still not comfortable with that term .

A lot of us , including myself , have had fun poking , jabbing , making fun of Palin , her lack of knowledge about the Constitution , her appearance on SNL , etc....

Where would he , ( McCain ) , be if he did not have her as his running mate

IMO.... she is helping him more now , because he is hurting himself , more .

She invigorated the far right wingers to actually go out and campaign for McCain , instead of apathetically voting for McCain to spite Obama .

Palin invigorated Obama 's campaign , and she is one of the reasons Obama raised $ 150 million dollars in September .

When I saw her speech at the convention , I immediately sent Obama as much money as I could .

Why on earth would women vote for the Green Party just because they have a female candidate ?

If the Government provides Health Care , whether spelled out in this bill or not , it will RATION the care .

The Government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone , even if they took all our money .

Specifically it identifies the elderly and those under the age of 2 as being less important and so they will be the first to suffer from reduced services .

Knowing that the Government can not efficiently run anything , I can promise it won't end there .

Since all healthcare is rationed , the question for me is do I want those decisions to rest with corporations whose sole reason for existence is to make a profit --- profits which depend upon insuring the healthiest among us , and denying coverage for those whom they may have to pay claims ?

That can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy , leaving me without any coverage at all and no prospects of obtaining coverage on my own ?

I see mr. Biker boys . Thanks for letting me know .

Have we already guaranteed our doom ?

So you are a warmist too ehh ?

Another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd . Since 1998 until today there has been no significant warming .

A further fact . In the early 1900 's scientists predicted that over the next 100 years the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree . And that is what it did .

Precission of the earths equinox refers to the earth 's axis wobble moving in an unconventional way .

This vid indicates inertia shifts in ice not to be due to global warming but due to physics of the earth , sun , moon system .

This inertia of the sun earth moon generates potential physical plate movements on earth , ie earthquakes .

So is this because of global warming or is it Bush 's fault ?

No unusual events in the paleo record seem to be associated with magnetic reversals .

Not , I suspect , as it relates to magnetic pole shift or drift .

People have no respect for their neighbors and I am talking about Americans here .

If they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen how can they have respect for themselves ?

Two Thumbs said he felt this too in PA .

Thought I was having a seizure or something at first , till I saw the water in my water bottle swaying back and forth .

The time of water wars is upon us with the privatization of water resources worldwide by multinational conglomerates who are not accountable to , or suppressible by the local populations they effect , even here in America .

' Flow , ' a documentary on what the privatization of water really means which was the inspiration for me creating this thread .

I am dying of thirst , which is the situation many in the world find themselves in now .

Water is resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allowed to become captured by any private concern .

Hey........30 years ago , I was reading about all kinds of hysterical doomsday theories of the extinction of this natural resource or that natural resource .

You get a few decades down the line and realize there are lots of smart people out there who roll out hysterical theories because they know there are millions of suckers out there who 'll buy it in a heartbeat and profit handsomely FTW ! !!

My wife works with the GAO a lot and she sent this report over to me .

But we will probably start doing it well after it will make no differance .

I went to youtube and checked out the Gulf oil crisis : all of the posts are one month old , or older...

The first two months there were hundreds of private citizens with their video cams reporting about what was happening in the gulf... showing everyone firsthand eyewitness accounts of the incompetence of BP and the lack of government response .

Now there are none : zero : nobody has posted one single video on youtube about the gulf oil crisi for one month .

gulf oil spill - Google Search = Plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media .

That 's the point : the oil has not been cleaned up : its sunk below the surface : just like all the true facts have sunk out of sight .

The dispersant they used , Corexit ; has destroyed all possibility of cleaning up the oil because it 's made the oil sunk below the surface .

BP 's use of corexit is a quick way of sweeping the problem under the carpet : idiots who do n't see the oil on the surface will assume that there is n't any ecological damage going on .

Instead , the ecological damage to the entire area is now a million times worse than it was when the oil was still on the surface .

To people who do n't live there : the horror of this catastrophe made worse by BP cannot be understated enough .

Yes you read that correctly....lets just assign a number because we want too !

These clowns commit this fraudulent behavior all the fricking time and old fraud , chris , konradv , trolling blunder and a whole host of others ignore this .

What is so distorted in their fundamental makeup that they can see this desecration of science and ignore it ?

In fact they support and revere it .

Yes , they have been extrapolating temps for areas where they had no direct measurement . However , as they stated , one should use the NCDC measurements for those areas , if very accurate measurements are desired .

Tomorrow , the Employment Situation Report comes out and as usual , there will be idiots claiming the government does n't count people not receiving unemployment benefits , or that the government is n't counting people who should be counted etc.

Question : What exactly do we want to measure and why ?

Answer : We want to measure the Labor Market and how it is changing , especially how difficult it is to get a job .

Next group are prisoners . While some " work " it 's not really a labor market system and working or not working are not free choices of entry and exit .

There remains many disabled who can n't work but are n't in an institution , but since some can and some can n't work , there 's no bright line , so we include them all .

For a country with mandatory retirement , or generous government pensions , that is sensible as almost all those over 65 do n't need to work and do n't work and including them can distort the picture .

But in the US , there is no mandatory retirement ( except in military/police ) and retirement benefits are not as generous or universal .

Last , military . For a while , they were counted as employed ( 1984 @-@ 1994 ) but since there 's no free exit and it 's not a market system , including them just raises the number of employed by a fairly constant level , so it 's better to exclude the military .

So we have our population : The Adult Civilian Non @-@ Institutional Population .

The key is to be as objective as possible .

Since we have to use a survey ( it 's just not possible to do a full count every month ) , any subjectivity will increase our error , so we have to avoid any possible overlaps or judgement calls .

Some have suggested a minimum number of hours worked , but is that a good idea ?

Plenty of people voluntarily work few hours , or in a particular week only work a few hours . Should we say they do n't really have a job or are n't really working ?

That 's very subjecive . We do n't want to run into cases were someone nomrmally works 40 hours a week , but in the particular week of the survey she only worked 2 hours and counted as unemployed .

So we set a bright line of 1 hour for pay , and also include those as employed people temporarily absent due to brief illness , injury , vacation , strike , bad weather etc.

Some people do n't get paid ( directly ) for work , either charity work or working on a family farm or family business .

Let 's not include charity work , because that 's not really part of the labor market .

But family business @/@ farm is a different story...the person is either just helping out , ( meaning if they do n't already have another job they would n't take one if they were n't working for family and @/@ or no one would have to be hired in their place ) or they are a substantial part of the business preventing them from another job and filling a job slot no one else can take .

So let 's set a bright line of 15 hours a week and anyone working without pay on family business farm 15 hours or more a week is employed .

What about someone hired but not yet working ?

Many things can happen , so we won't call them employed until they 're actually working .

So let 's not count anyone who does n't want a job .

Should we count everyone who says they want a job ?

They could be unable to take a job if offered ( meaning they 're not available labor ) .

If someone is actually looking for work , sending a resume , going to an interview , on the union list , then we can safely assume that they are really available for work .

But if someone is n't DOING anything about a getting a job , then they 're not available , anymore than someone who does n't want to work .

Sure they may still consider themselves " unemployed " and they may sincerely want to work , but since they 're not available , since they 're not part of the actual supply of labor and can n't be hired , we exclude them .

So we have our Employed , we have our Unemployed....this is our Labor Force , our available supply of people who can work or be hired .

Since the population tends to grow , for an historical comparison , it 's better to look at rates/ratios/percentages to get a clearer picture .

Labor Force Participation Rate : The Labor Force as a percent of the Population .

This can be largely affected by non @-@ economic factors as the increase of women into the labor force in the 60 s and 70 s showed , but it gives a good look at how much of the population is trying to work .

Employment @-@ Population Ratio : this tells us the percent of the population that 's actually working .

Unemployment rate : Unemployed as a percent of the Labor Force .

This tells us how much of available labor...people willing and able and available to work... is not being used .

This is all economic factors...the percent of people trying and failing to get a job .

Of course not...it 's not meant to .

It does n't tell us types of job , if people are working as much as they want to , people who do n't believe they would be successful .

But it tells us what we 're looking for : the percent of people who we know for sure cannot get a job .

You can make believe things are getting better or you can understand that things are getting worse and deal with it .

You chose to make believe .

We have people looking for work who have been looking for three years or more .

We have folks just plain resigning from the work force and do n't look any more .

Even under the regime of 99 week unemployment rather than 26 week , we have large numbers who have gone beyond benefits .

And does " it " need to be maintained ?

" Jobs " comes from the Current Employment Statistics Survey ( CES ) while Unemployment ( and total employment ) comes from the Current Population Survey ( CPS ) .

The CES is non @-@ farm payroll employment . It excludes agriculture , the self @-@ employed , unpaid family workers and private employees ( private cooks , nannies , maids , etc ) .

You can n't directly compare 2 measures that measure different things .

You can n't just look at one number or one measure and say " things are good " or " things are bad ."

Instead we get reports on the number of people who SELF REPORTED they are n't working but are looking for work .

To find out all we have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and remember that Obama voted to the left of Sanders while in the Senate .

God help us all if Obama ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist Fed Chairman .

Oh , and we might remember that when their God , Keynes , was asked about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policies he said , do n't worry about the future , we 'll all be dead .

Bernie Sanders : Another very important issue is with unemployment so high , how can we strengthen the Fed 's full @-@ employment mandate[ with inflation] and ensure that it conducts monetary policy to achieve maximum employment ? [ through inflation].

In other words the Fed has a number of mandates and one of them is to control inflation .

Well I would argue that by definition when you have 16 % of people unemployed and underemployed it really is not .

They 'd do exactly what they 've done since 1913 .

Lend out " money " that does n't exist , charge interest for it , inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pockets in the process .

Then , they 'd bankroll endless stupid foreign wars , the socialistic welfare state , massive Ponzi schemes , endless bailouts of states , cities , corporations and foreign nations....

The same thing a conservative Fed would do , and then they 'd call it brilliant and give obama the credit .

What he 's saying is n't , obviously , that we should n't care about the long run .

We need not only theories of the long run , but also theories of the short run .

" Global warming is real - it is man @-@ made and it is an important problem . But it is not the end of the world." - who said it ?

i think this issue is only valuable for the purposes of supporting commoditization of CO2. that 's my explanation for why all of the funded scientists point to the gas and build the anthro argument . i dont see how it is credible in light of more dominant causes .

I 'm curious Dante...Dosen't the temp change by about 40 degrees , every year , in the northern and southern hemisphere ? Also , with warmer temps and more co2 in the atmosphere , would n't the number and variety of plants and trees increase ? What ever happened to the rain forest , nuclear meltdown , ozone layer , global cooling , or any of the other iminent catastrophes that will befall us if we do n't do something RIGHT NOW ! !? The only environmental issue important to envronmentalists is whatever one can generate the most money . At least oil companies get their cash by providing us with something we need . You enviro @-@ whackos get yours by doing absolutely nothing at all , except making life harder for everyone else .

In reality humans contribute about 5 % to global worming in terms of CO2 release into the atmosphere . Yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can , but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming . It is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only 20 years . Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused . The problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution . They have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect .

Consider too Rapid Climate Change Events as documented by paleoclimatological data from ice cores drilled out of Antarctica and atmospheric analysis of gas frozen in the ice . This heating process occurs every 22,000 years like clockwork for the past 150,000 years that our records go back . Guess what...it has been just about 22,000 years...fancy that .

Remember in the 80 s when the next ice age was around the corner and we were all going to freeze to death ?

Very simple . Adapting to a rapidly changing climate is preferable to changing our present habits , no matter how destructive they are to the coming generations , or to the rest of the biosphere .

For most people , the present rapid changes are already stretching their abilities to adapt . They see jobs that they considered safe niches now gone forever , with no demand for skills that took years to develop , and now the scientists are telling them that they have to change even more . That we should cease to use fossil fuels asap , that we need to switch to an energy base that features nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , and other non @-@ polluting sources , that they do not understand , and have no experiance with .

I see otherwise intelligent people convincing themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rising in the West simply because they wish to avoid any more changes in the lives , and the way that they live . Which , of course , pushes the changes onto their children , and grandchildren , who will be facing a much more serious situation concerning the effects of a changing climate , a rapidly changing climate , than we face today .

Well , that is the culture of this nation , and our children will suffer the consequences of our inability to face reality .

How long would we live if we could replace body parts with exact matches ?

How about replacing our whole bodies and exchanging brains with that of a clone ?

Perhaps one has an inalienable right to patent ones own body and its specific type .

Do we own our own uniqueness ?

i am not real sure what that means but i am sure xox can explain it...

the so called " clone " is a human from your cells...not a spare parts factory for you .

that dollie 's lambs ( remember the sheep that was cloned ) age faster due to her age at the beginning....

so you would have to clone your infant...

now tell me....you have spare infant identical to the one you gave birth too and your not gonna love it....

Would I be able to order clones of Elisha Cuthbert and Jessica Alba that I could keep as sex slaves ?

31 US troops were killed when the Chinook carrying them crashed .

Our MSM does n't seem very interested in covering the Afghan War much . I 'm really not sure why .

Over One Million Iraqi Deaths Caused by US Occupation

They did the same training , made it through .

And maybe they snicker a little , but they should n't !

Maybe you never served in any Military branch and have no frame of reference ?

Not to diminish the great Navy Fleet Sailors who keep the gigantic ships running with all kinds of technical skills , Coast Guard people are the real Sailors who navigate tiny boats in high seas to rescue people , arrest criminals and keep America 's shores safe .

It 's not surprising that they could complete SEAL training if they wanted to .

I 've been reading through several news sites tonight and I just picked up on a great story about a US Air Force pilot who probably saved a lot of US Military lives in the early goings of the Iraq War .

Now let 's get one thing straight , I initially agreed with the reason for going into Iraq , but I no longer agree with it .

I support Obama 's decision to pull our troops out by next year .

I always , 100 % side with our brave men and women who are putting themselves in harm 's way .

He is just 2 years short of retirement .

He 's flown missions in Iraq , Afghanistan , Kosovo and has been awaiting re @-@ deployment a new tour of duty .

Back in April , 2003 the Army was making the initial advance to capture Baghdad Int'l airport , Victor and his wingmen found an Iraqi ambush site of about 12 APCs that were less than a mile from the Army advance .

At the time , his wingman was suffering from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibited him from deploying his weapons .

Within a timespan of 20 @-@ 30 minutes , he and his wingman were finally able to deploy all of their weapons and destroy the 8 APCs that were about to ambush the US Army on their mission to take Baghdad International Airport .

They took out the entire enemy position and that night the Army captured Baghdad International Airport .

Why am I posting this when there have been several hundred if not thousand of other US Soldiers , Seamen and Pilots who have each served their country heroicly and have also won medals , which some have even died for ?

Because this hero was 2 years away from retirement and is being discharged , against his will , from the Air Force . Is this because of bad behavior ? No. He has an excellent record of service and has never had any problems . Then why , if this 18 @-@ year veteran who is an excellent Pilot of the US Air Force being discharged against his will , 2 years before he retires ?

Because he 's openly gay . He 's commanded squadrons , saved other American soldiers ' lives and served with honor .

But because he is different than we are , because he is sexually attracted to men , his sexuality trumps the incredible record of service he 's had over 18 years .

Are you telling me that the most professionally trained , the meanest , the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its given , cannot accept men or women who have different seuxality tastes than other people ?

Men and women who fight to save our country , who are more than willing to die to protect our freedom , must NOT be discriminated against .

In these troubled times we simply cannot do without this significant portion of potential enlistees , and talented senior members , to uphold an absurd , and bigoted , policy .

Most absurdly , we are allowing ourselves to fire Arabic language specialists , people whose positions are critical at this time , due to a trait that has no effect on the performance of their duties .

I know congress has a lot on their plates right now , but they need to move on this soon .

Preferably with a solution that would allow soldiers lost to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to .

The military is against things that make it run less efficiently .

Allowing blacks to enter the military increased its numbers and productivity thus the long term goals outweighed the short term unease .

Because of the nature of the military and close quarters shared especially among men in war simulation , training and actual warfare the distraction of having someone who you know may be attracted to you can ultimately cause death because you are distracted .

The Army , as demonstrated by its successful execution of D @-@ Day during WWII , is also capable of making daring amphibious assaults , so why not just disolve the Marines into the Army ?

The Marine Corps must maintain a minimum of 3 Divisions and can not be disbanded without a Congressional act .

Got friends in the 101 and 82 nd Airborne or Airmoble .

They were attempting to go @-@ light and were using our FMFM 's to teach em techniques .

You just know I have to weigh in on this one !

Each service and the Marines have their unique roles .

There are of course some similarities and overlap between them .

Each service thinks their requirements are more important than the other service 's .

Because not everything gets funded , we go to war with the military we have and not the military we want .

Obviously , there has been interservice rivalry since the first ship went to sea with fighting men on board .

The army has brotherhood beef with the marines but we recognize that the marines are a unique unrivaled infantry machine .

The Army has the ability to meet any infantry requirement anywhere and is set up for long term missions .

They are far from the same and if combined would defeat the purpose of their original designs .

I have two sons in the Marine Corp , both of whome recently completed their MOS training and headed to their permanent duty stations .

He was telling me that the Army trainee 's had top salute the Marines ( no matter their rank ) ....

that to me shows the respect that the Army has for the elite US fighting force...and a respect that would be lost if they were part of the Army .

He also told me that the Air Force guys got additional pay for being stationed on the same base as Marines and that the Marines were not allowed to go round in groups of more than 4 , because they were concerned about what they could do to anyone .

And a Mother especially.....where is the Motherly love and the Mother instinct to protect her children ? ?

I once found myself holding a steak knife @- ready to plunge it into my chest .

And I did , in my mind .

It was one of but two miracles that I 've witnessed in my life .

They black out to one singular vision that is a reality of past present and future . And for that I hold them ( and once myself ) harmless .

Drugs . Valle had over 20 different kinds of drugs she was taking .

Neither one will go down in the history books as the best in theirsports............................

Both were considered shoe @-@ ins duringtheirprime

I want to say something else too though .

I watched a documentary about Tyson once , it was one that focused more on his fighting career than his personal life .

If I remember correctly he won 19 out of his first 20 professional fights by first round knock out , generally consummated by a left @-@ upper @-@ cut struck on the jaw that would lift a 220 @-@ pound man two feet off the mat .

Its impossible to compare athletes from different eras .

Regardless of his skills , he never had the competition during his era to be considered the greatest

I found out today that the Blockbuster Video that I go to is closing down .

This is the fourth store in my area to close in the last year , and I 'm actually a bit upset about it , because the few that remain are n't close enough to drive to .

Blockbusters already drove the mom and pop videostores out of business , and they are being driven out by movies on line , movies on demand , and movies by mail @- businesses they are trying to get into .

I guess some would call this progress , but I think we are losing something as well .

Redbox is a simpler version of Blockbuster , in that you can still go to a Redbox and browse and get a movie right then and there .

I actually prefer the Redbox because it does n't have nearly as much selection .

You can get some great deals on movies @/@ tv shows as they unload their inventory .

Also , when ours closed down they offered a free movie ( that you were buying anyways , I think whatever the cheapest movie you were purchasing ) and a month free of Blockbuster online ( it 's like Netflix ) .

For me , part of the fun of renting movies was going to the store with your chick and picking them out , bullshitting with other people in the store , etc.

God forbid we have to leave the house for an hour and move our limbs .

The guy that notified his superiors , who should have called the cops .

I assume he assumed after reporting it up the chain that something would be done .

I do though think the school made the right move last night , just wish Joe had been able to go out on a more positive note after what he 's done for nearly fifty years at PSU .

Julia Gillard has beaten her predecessor Kevin Rudd in a ballot for the federal Labor leadership by a margin of 73 votes to 29 .

2. Rudd has said he would retire if he lost .

The local papers are of the opinion that , whomever won the leadership contest , the Labour Party was likely to be heavily damaged going into next year 's elections .

Local OWS activists were part of this protest .

Shortly before the protesters arrived , Capitol Police discovered a truck laden with explosives parked outside the capitol .

Second , I have a really hard time believing that there were any ACTUAL " explosives , " since the news story they link to talks about one guy getting arrested for THREATENING Governor Brownback .

Doubly so since they apparently did not even bother to tow the truck , so clearly there was n't a serious threat .

Translation out of hype @-@ speak : some kook made threatening noises at Brownback and got arrested . The end .

Of what Am I trying to convince you ?

I 'm expressing my own views here .

And possibly adding to my knowledge if I 'm convinced there 's justification .

I am , and remain skeptical .

What it is , who put it there , and why remain , for me , unknown , and also remain deciding factors for me .

Wingnut @/@ Hard for me to grasp . Goodness , disagreeing with you causes personal attacks . Not hard to believe when considering the weakness of your argument .

I turned on my coputer this morning and instead of opening the internet to my Google home page ( White ) it opened to a page called " Blackle " which was black .

I " Blackled " it and found out they changed the page to black to save energy .

Any teeth to this and if so , does it make enough of a differrence for web developers to switch ?

I just Googled Google and when I click on the first selection it takes me to the white Google page , so apparently we still have a choice .

The new search from Google has the Blackle.com address , not google .

Also , when we have a choice for skins , like I think we do ( or did at one time ) here on A2K , then we could all contribute to the energy savings by using the black skin , right ?

( Although I find the black page harder to read.)

Or , whether or not it is that significant ?

I heard it costs upwards of one million dollars to execute one prisoner ; that sure buys a whole lot of years in prison .

A concurrent thread has touched on the the role of religion in the US Civil Rights movement , and its place in the US constitution .

I think you are answering if two men are the " same " and not necessarily if they are equal in rights or should be .

I see equality as a goal to strive for , although in effect , it is somewhat arbitrary , dependant on the whims of changing times .

While riding the bus earlier this week , I overheard a man say that if he " had the guts to do it , " he would jump off an overpass .

He followed up with an affirmation that he would never do it because he would never find those guts .

We are probably all familiar with the traditional saying regarding suicide - that it is a " coward 's way out ."

After all , we are speaking of terminating one 's own life , perhaps forever ending one 's existence .

We all have our thoughts on what comes next , but no one can be certain .

One may be forever ending his existence , or he may be forever subjecting himself to punishment if the religious views on suicide being a sin are correct .

Either way though , one is entering the unknown by willingly terminating his life , which blatantly violates the biological drive to live , to continue existing .

How can this not be an extremely courageous act , much more so that " finding the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problems ? "

Remaining alive to face one 's problems is continuing the state of existence that one has always known .

Ending that life is journeying into something new , something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual is comfortably familiar with .

Either way he is terminating his life and accepting the state of death that deep down we all fear .

[INDENT]One is fearful of some thing One overcomes their fear to do that thing In so doing , one can therefore said to have courage [/INDENT]

Although I must admit , it strikes me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy words to such an act .

" He had the courage to kill himself "; though correct in this sense , leads to a ' destructive ' conclusion .

As a side note , labeling it as a " cowardly " or " easy " way out - I think - is simply people using derision to express their disapproval .

I can also envision a state where , for me , such a solution could be warranted ; not a good one to be sure , but conceivable nonetheless .

@WithoutReason , It is a purely courageous act , especially if you prepared for it so that it was least painful for your loved ones .

I do n't know if it could be argued as a logical choice , per se , especially if you had not yet tried letting go of all the things that bring you down ( psychologically speaking ) .

But , if you just got your arms and legs blown off by and IED , then by all means , have at it . ( Err...have someone do it for you.)

According to most analyses , from within and without the petroleum Industry , the world supply of oil , relative consumption , will effectively peak in the next decade .

Some nations will be priced out , most likely the relatively undeveloped countries in which automotive transportation is not really essential .

Obviously , war is a possiblity ; they have been fought for far less in the past .

If this were suddenly to halt or risk collapse , would that ruling party push the country into war , either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction , as so many authoritarian regimes have done in the past ?

There is shift of power occuring in Asia , as China and Russia exert their influence .

The Shangai Cooperation Organization of which they , along with Ian , Pakistan and most of the former Soviet republics , are memebers , has stated that it intends to remove U.S. influence from the region and failitate the rise of a ' multi @-@ polar world .'

I do n't want to guess their specific motives , but it seems to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nations in the event of a crisis brought on by peak oil .

Between Russia and Iran , they would have access to enormous oil reserves , from which they could , if supplies were too short , deny the U.S. Saudi Arabia comes to mind as well .

As anyone who has done even the most superficial research on that nation would know , the House of Saud is a joke , a paper tiger and a tyranny hated by most of its people .

If elections were held their , or if there was a struggle for power , the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with Iran and extremely antagonistic to the U.S.: quite understandably I might add .

With the largest oil reserves in the world , it is vital that the U.S. maintain contorl over Saudi Arabia , which means propping up the House of Saud , and it would be equally benificial to Iran or to China and its partners in Asia to facilitate a revolution there , which would allow them greater access by default .

And so , after all that , which you might justly consider paranoia , my question is basically this ; in light of the threat of peak oil , and of the general decline in American economic might relative the rest of the world ( not to mention the current U.S. crisis ) , what do think the world will look like in a decade or two ?

If American hegemony fails , as appears inevitable , what will be its replacement ?

I really , really hope that alternative sources are being as enthusiastically @-@ pursued as the urgency of the situation dictates they should .

But the first , perhaps facetious , response I had to " what would happen "-question was to recall the 80 's movies : Mad Max , and Mad Mad : Road Warrior

I 'll admit though : There 's a part of me that wants to see all this fossil @-@ fuel B.S. come tumbling down .

Even if it set transportation , technology and civilization in general back some , I 'd think a " reboot in a better direction " ( read : away from finite resources , fossil fuels ) is so much the better .

Yea , more war over oil resources is likely ; perhaps even inevitable .

There is no question that the coming century will see a confluence and will be a critical turning point in human history .

We may very well be called upon to choose between collective life and death .

But if we do n't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under its own weight , the next generations of humans will have to do without the major stepping stone of an oil based economy .

They may not be able to kickstart their own industrial era .

I just Read of Arthur C Clark 's death in Sri Lanka -- he is primarily know as a science fiction author , but his science fiction presaged many of the technologies that we now consider plebian .

I enjoyed his books and his perspective on things .

I could n't for the life of me figure out where to post this question , so I thought I 'd put it here since it 's biologically relevant... somewhat .

Do n't ask me why but I need to know what happens if you dye your eyebrows .

Say you want to disguise yourself by bleaching dark hair blonde and that you wanted to do the eyebrows as well to complete the disguise .

Now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you 'll lose the blonde @-@ ness , but what about the eyebrows ?

I do n't remember ever having them cut or trimmed , so would they stay blonde ?

Eyebrows have a different " terminal length " than head @-@ hair -- that is , they grow to a certain length ( and not longer ) , then fall out .

I do n't think soz is looking to disguise herself .

The short haired dog has hair strands that ( on the average ) fall out or break before the average long @-@ haired dog 's .

Eyebrow hairs grow much slower than head hair , so if you dye everything together , your head hair will show " roots " long before the eyebrows do .

I dye my eyebrows all the time , whether I 'm doing a touch up to the roots , or my entire head .

I do n't know how fast my eyebrows grow , but after 2 weeks there 's always a grey one in there somewhere .

I guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them .

BTW , when you 're dying them , use a Q @-@ tip , and make sure you get it all the way to the root .

A " Theory " is nothing more than an explanation of known facts...when and if the facts change , the theory would be expected to change . Therefore , any proposed " Theory " that is not supported by known facts is to be rejected . However , support for any one theory does not

Facts , not interpetations , are the basis for evaluation . An open and

But this premise assumes that life as we know it is the only form of life that *can* exist . And I disagree with this assumption .

The life we see around us evolved in this Universe as conditions allowed , so it 's not surprising at all that everything fits nicely . Other Universes with different rules would necessarily have life in them which fits that universe . And Universes which are sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they are not there .

The really interesting thing to realize is that life evolves in Universes ( at least this one ) at all . Is the evolution of life in a Universe pure chance , or is it inevitable ?

In our universe at least , life not only can exist , but does exist . And that means that our Universe is itself , alive , in a very real sense . And we are its thoughts .

A variant on the multi universe which seems to me obvious , and very real , is the infinite universe .

Here the universe that we perceive is simply one cell of infinity , the others being like or unlike " cells " beyond our own , but filling the remainder of " everything " beyond our specific " this " with " otherthings ", identical , or not .

If we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from , as we interpret it , and with our current ability to decern at sub nano levels , the smallest subatomic particles through atoms , molecules , solids , constructs , and on , and on , and on , to planets , star systems , galaxies , and on to our entire known universe .

Would it not be foolish to assume this " Mandelbrot " like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe , rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined levels of structure , and beyond to infinity ( infinity , of course not being a point , but rather a lack of constraint quantifier ) .

I was working on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while I enjoyed the incoherent rambling argument on whether there is a god or not Im feeling kind of empty . The universe is the way it is because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte is a god or not . And trying to justify the existence of god through anything dealing with relativity is laughable . God is only able to exist through faith . And faith goes against everything that science stands for .

A key issue in disscussion of " life " and " universes " is what constitutes " structure " or " order ". For example , to take BGW 's ( and Capra 's ) fractal model of embedded " structures " we are still left with the regression problem of " who observes @/@ defines such structure ".

My own conclusion is that terms like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " events " in the single universe . I am saying that the occurence of " life " is not an " event " in the usual sense because events presuppose " observers " who classify them as such . ( Observation in " our minds eye " is cognitive sleight of hand ) Note also the term " multi " implies " one who classifies or counts " and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?

Rather than take a reductionist view proposing infinite , slightly different universes that somehow interact ( alah M @-@ Theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the Landauer @-@ Lloyd analysis of flaws in the of the Laplace 's demon argument that supports reductionists . Basically this states the final outcome of a system may not be soley defined by outcomes written into the basic laws of physics * a gazzillion atoms , but there can be " a cosmic imperative " written into the laws of nature ( Paul Davies - Macquarie Uni - Sydney , Australia - Emergent biological principles and the computational resources of the universe , Complexity vol 10( 2 ) , p1 "

So basically ultra complex systems can produce wierd outcomes ; such as rocks , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw materials - simply arranged slightly differentally . This might bring down the number of universes required to create life from infinite to merely fairly large !

How long are we supposed to wait to see if this womans brain will ever rewire effectively before we move on ?

We Americans have let our victim fetish get so bad that we are pathetic .

If I were in AZ @-@ 08 , I think this would be a fair question but I 'm not sure of what the mechanism to remove a Congresswoman is other than the ballot box .

Strom Thurmond was not all there but still held his office with the consent of his constituents .

I think as long as her constituents are ok with it , we do n't get a say .

That does n't seem incidental or trivial to me .

Gabrielle Giffords was voted in because people agreed with her policies and approach to politics .

She hand @-@ selected this group of people who now make up her office , with the intent of working together to implement her vision .

In that way , she is still the representative , as these people take her stated vision and priorities and work to make them happen .

If Giffords is unable to recover fully before the next election , I think it would make sense that her second @-@ in @-@ command , or whomever has been most instrumental in the work that her office has been doing since the injury , goes ahead and runs in her place .

I think engineer 's point about not encouraging removal from office by gunshot is a good one .

The members of the minority party in the House of Representatives are largely ciphers anyway , although only a few of them have the excuse that they suffer from medically certifiable brain damage .

All the Democrats in the house could take a year @-@ long vacation and the results would largely be the same , so Giffords 's absence from her duties is hardly consequential .

Indeed , the country would benefit if more congressmen could be induced to take extended breaks from their duties .

It might be a good idea to keep track of this woman . Some basics from her wiki biography might be helpful .

The Congresswoman , who is about to turn 55 , was born in Iowa . When her parents divorced , she moved to Minnesota with her mother . She worked in a kibbutz after high school , attended Winona State University , the now defunct law school at Oral Roberts University and the William and Mary Law School where she took a master 's degree in tax law .

She has been married for 30 years . " Bachmann and her husband own a Christian counseling clinic in Stillwater , Minnesota .

Bachmann also has an ownership stake in Waumandee , Wisconsin farm land . Since the death of her father @-@ in @-@ law , the farm and its buildings have been rented out to a neighboring farmer who maintains a dairy herd on the farm . From 1995 through 2006 , the tenant @-@ farmer received $ 251,973 in federal subsidies , chiefly for dairy and corn price supports ."

Initially a Democrat , she became disillusioned with Jimmy Carter . In 1976 , the CHristian documentary by Francis Schaeffer , " How Should We Then Live ? " impelled her to take up an anti @-@ abortion stance and she and her fiance began praying outside abortion facilities .

" In 1993 , Bachmann and other parents started a K @-@ 12 charter school in Stillwater , and she began speaking against a state @-@ mandated set of educational standards , which propelled her into the world of politics .

Bachmann became an outspoken critic and opponent of Minnesota 's School @-@ to @-@ Work policies . In a 1999 column , she wrote : " School @-@ to @-@ Work alters the basic mission and purpose of K @-@ 12 academic education away from traditional broad @-@ based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual . Instead , School @-@ to @-@ Work utilizes the school day to promote children 's acquisition of workplace skills , viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity."*

Now , if her running mate were to be someone named Turner , the dems could be in trouble , like , a Bachmann @-@ Turner ticket would blow them off the road once the campaign got into overdrive .

Doubt if she 'd adopt an anti @-@ vocational ed stance , though .

All I know , is the more I see her on television , the better .

It made me laugh ( and I am American ) .

IMHO , Michele Bachmann is not as sharp as a bowling ball and has no business even thinking about running for President .

I love watching Michele Bachmann . She is funnier than any sitcom on television . Bad thing is she makes Mitt Ronmey look very solid . I mean , compared to Palin and Bachmann , Romney sounds like Einstein LOL .

I believe that Bachmann has a real chance of beating Romney for the nomination . I think it will come down to the two of them , and Romney 's negatives , from being a Mormon to having taken so many positions in the past that annoy conservatives .

A " selection of recent articles on the Republican presidential wannabe and Tea Party darling ", from the New Statesman HERE

As amusing as a Bachmann candidacy would be , itll never happen . There are some intelligent people in the RNC who realize that this would be tantamount to handing over the presidential race to Obama without firing a shot . The RNC is scared that the public may love her like they do Sarah.With the GOP trying to find its " center of mass " they are p[arading out these clowns that can only cause them big trouble in November 2012

Politicians running for mid @-@ term elections are attacking their opponents and in doing so , stretching truths where ever they may be found .

i figure someone should just start a website called They All Lie dot com and just post pics of all the candidates , that would certainly make it easier

We 've left the information age , we are well into the opinion age .

That idiotic GOP " Pledge to America " was ripped to shreds by Factcheck.org , but it won't matter because those who believe it ( or at least believe in the idea of it ) won't ever dare venture near a fact checking source .

I think we need a new web service that fact checks , but also tracks who comes and reads the facts .

You must have been reading the Pledge to America , in which the GOP promises to return the country to failed Bush policies of borrow and spend and the elimination of oversight and regulation .

( Check with the Brits who went through this relative to their version of social security.)

While the hostilities between internal factions of the clerical regime and their feuding over the sham election is escalating , the people of Tehran , particularly young people , demonstrated in their thousands in different parts of the city including Fatemi Street , Vali @-@ Asr Street and Square , Vanak Square , Shariati Street , Takht @-@ e @-@ Tavoos Street and Sa'adatabad against the illegitimate and fraudulent election .

Dear Fellow American , This 4 th of July , while you and your family celebrate the 230 th Anniversary of the founding of our great nation , there 's one party you won't be invited to...

You see , this party is n't to honor your freedoms -- but to conspire to take them away .

Over our July 4 th holiday , on American soil , they are preparing to enact a legally @-@ binding treaty that would give the U.N. unchallengeable power to ban civilian ownership of ALL firearms .

That means your rifles , your shotguns and your handguns . AND YOUR FREEDOM !

To learn what you can do to stop the U.N .' s global gun ban treaty @-@ before it destroys our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms visit www.stopungunban.org .

Just as a handful of patriots fired the " shot heard ' round the world " at Concord Bridge , it 's up to you and me and every patriot who cherishes our Bill of Rights to tell the world today that our nation will not be bullied by the U.N.

Thank you for acting today .

Throw ' em out , and drop out .

This organization has been financed with U.S. tax dollars since its inception , and all it does it feed off of the money and try to kill the host . F--- ' em .

Odd , such an extensive website about the threat of this global gun ban treaty , a dozen webpages at least -- and it doesnt actually seem to have a single link to the actual text of said proposed ban .

Do n't those NRA members want to check out for themselves what the text actually says ?

Do n't you want to know what that ban treaty actually says ?

Try reading the UN treaty when you sober up cj..

you might find it is n't even close to what you desperately want to think it is .

What makes you think the NRA lets little facts like that get in the way of stirring up fear ?

Like the UN is going to actually demand that we close our firearm factories , and they are just going to lock the doors because of this treaty .

Who cares , would you rather have your hard earned tax dollars spent by keeping them behind bars .

Firing squad is probably pretty quick , but I do n't know that it 's used much .

I tried to look up their website , but it was blocked at work .

Interesting - I have n't heard of them before and was curious .

Obama 's view that affirmative action should , after these many years , continue may lead to his defeat in November .

Affirmative action equates to discrimination against nonbeneficiaries , usually while males . Obama says he is against quotas , but so @-@ called goals are invariable set up .

Obama should assidiously avoid the AA term and instead embrace programs the benefit the economically disadvantaged , regardless of race , gender , or ethnic origin .

All Obama has to do it make the point , repeatedly , that McCain 's position is anti @-@ women and he is for increasing the roles women play in the workplace and he 's got a winner .

The funny thing is that more Americans support Affirmative Action than oppose it ( this Gallup Poll shows 49 @-@ 43 in favor of AA for racial minorities ) .

The Conservatives do n't understand that turning the majority of Americans into " liberals " is not a good electoral strategy ( as they saw in the 2006 elections and will see again in November ) .

My brother , who is a General in the US Army , self identifies as conservative but is a BIG believer in affirmative action .

I self identify as a moderate liberal and definately identify as a woman am not nearly the supporter he is .

Obama is n't against ALL racism , just some of it .

Anti @-@ semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of 9 @/@ 11 against people questioning that account .

" Anti @-@ semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of 9 @/@ 11 against people questioning that account ."

Only when obvious anti @-@ Semites try to say " the Jews did it , " might that allegation made .

So , anti @-@ Zionists often become anti @-@ Semites , rather than do the intellectual efforts to parse the two concepts .

When asked why no economists support her tax holiday plan , she said they were elitists who do n't understand the pain the common man is in .

McCain says he will pay for it with spending reductions , Clinton with taxes on oil companies .

There is no support for this in Congress and the President has denounced it .

If the tax is repealed , several commentators feel the refiners will take some for themselves since they have also been hurt by rising prices .

We tell our children to work hard , get a good education and become experts in their fields , but if they disagree with a politician , they become latte drinking elitists out of touch with the hard working common man .

I 'm sure there are some economists of priviledge out there as well as some who propose solutions based on theories without regard to the impact of their ideas , but Clinton does n't have any economists who support her proposal , so what 's the deal ?

interesting I think , is the poll released this morning on MSNBC detailing that 45 % think the gas tax holiday is a good thing while 49 % think it 's bad .

Engineer Engineer , I repeat my response on another of your topics .

The oil companies would end up with the money by raising their prices and the public would get nothing .

Clinton and McCain are trying to win votes with nickle and dime stuff ;

our economy is straining so badly , it needs more than $ 600 tax rebates or one @-@ time summer relief from taxes ;

Some dunderheads will fall for these gimmicks , and vote for them in November .

Hillary once elected might go not thru with it .

That is not to say she lied but that wiser heads may counsel her to pass it up .

His absence has been explained many times in many different ways , but he has virtually disappeared from the scene .

Rumsfeld , who was enjoying a limelight , is now being asked to keep a low profile , since his abrasive personality has alienated so many .

Poor Bush , no matter how many times they parade him , still is n't impressive .

A lot of public appearance is left to Ari Fleischer , which is his job , but he does n't exactly have such an ingratiating personality either .

He is spending time in the bowels of Hell with his real boss , plotting and planning .

K @-@ Mart is closing 326 stores and laying off approximately 35,000 people .

President Bush on the other hand continues to claim the economy is strong , not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless .

He has however presented a package which he contends will stimulate the economy and create jobs .

In addition if the economy remains sluggish what are Bush 's chances for re @-@ election ?

Yeah , it 'll stimulate the top ten percent of the wealthy in this country , but will do nothing for our economy .

Well , I thought it would be nice to see that title somewhere...since I can n't find it in Reality....

It is wild to me how such an effective , strong , woman -- the closest advisor to the most powerful person in the world -- has garnered no more support , no accolades from women and blacks -- two groups who are always trying to find successful sisters or positive stories of black achievement .

I have noticed a distinct discrimination among women and blacks in whom they will ballyhoo , and whom they won't .

Clarence Thomas is unwelcomed among his own race .

Even if he had a disfiguring pigment problem and a third leg , if he were the slightest bit liberal -- he 'd have statues and streets named after him already .

I heard a Georgia mayor on NPR today , and was heartened .

He was explaining to the ( of course , liberal ) quizzical reporter how he could be a Republican .

It was as if he had to apologize to the entire black community...

I was proud that he told the reporter he felt racially stereotyped to be expected to be a Democrat .

It is to the great , abiding shame of women and blacks to turn their backs on the great achievements of these people .

It is the New Racism ; by blacks against blacks .

Some liberals do n't much cotton to " uppity " blacks like Powell , Thomas and Rice confronting racial discrimination and outright racism and leaving the plantation of dependency on white liberals and achieving the great things they are capable of .

Gotta ' keep ' em in their place , you know .

Yet Bush mentioned that background as though she actually did anything beyond striving toward her own growth .

More power to her for her achievements .

But do n't be surprised if you 're not hearing wild applause from her community , because I 'm not sure she has one...

Assuming she establishes a credible name for herself as Secretary of State , I am cautiously anticipating the GOP nominee in 2008 to be Condoleeza Rice .

Americans , especially Republican Americans , have largely left issues of racism and @/@ or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them .

Any qualified person with charisma and a track record can compete with clout .

I keep hearing that inflation is under control .

And I suppose it is if one does not need to put food on the table , buy gasoline , heating oil , electricity and many of the necessities of life .

This whole economy seems to be based on the comfort level of the ones referred to by Dubya as his base .

Please read this if you do n't instantly see why... http : //www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1632736,00.html

He researches and practices evidence based politics and thus virtually every policy he sought no matter how unpopular proved a success .

And he like you knows how to balance budgets without hurting the economy .

But , offset Hillary 's " Northeastern Elite " and " inexperienced " negatives with Bloomberg 's " Northeastern Elite " and " inexperienced " negatives ? Not so much .

personally i look upon this conflict as the source of 90 % of western @-@ muslim 's confrontation ,

the US needs and so supports Israel , Israel wants to stop attacks on its citizens and so strike on palestinian targets , which in turn results in more attacks on Israel , this increases the number of radical muslims too , which results in attacks against america around the world( military targets , embassies , and citizens ) resulting in american foriegn policy like the war on Iraq and @/@ or Afghanistan , and the circle continues , reactions to actions resulting in reactions , this circle having No beginning and no end

is not easy to solve , but if we try to and start by the issue at core( palestinian @-@ Israeli conflict ) the rest can be handled ,

i want to start a thread here , that simulates peace negotiations between two sides , palestinians ( me and who ever volunteers ) against Israeli side ( i suppose Volunteer wouldnot mind representing them and any one he chooses )

each side is allowed one posting per day , then after every two posts its discussed freely by all for two days , then each side makes a post , as the palestinian side is the one with most demands lets let them start( if its ok by all ) ,

i need ur OK guys and Girls .

very true , the same people who said SADDAM violated UN resolutions , seem to forget , ISRAEL has been in violation of UN resolutions for decades .

Give up hell , tell them to come get it ?

That goes for Isreal too , if Egypt or Syria were anything worthwhile , Isreal would n't of got what they did .

To the victor goes the spoils .

Glad I 've never backed the UN .

Israel is Western , civilized , the progenitors of the first Christian community , and facing total annihilation every day of its life , thanks to being surrounded by psycopathic states .

So you think if Isreal stopped retaliating , the attacks would stop ?

No chance of that , they would chip at them untill they were extinct .

Max Blumenthal goes to the Young Republicans convention in DC , and asks why none of them - who strongly support the WoT and the War in Iraq - have bothered to sign up and serve in the armed forces .

Republicans get mad when the ' Chickenhawk ' argument is brought up , and this is because it is damned effective .

They usually attempt to counter with some version of this line :

There is a perceivable and significant differnce between those who discuss war , who think it is sometimes necessary , and who are willing to do what must be done for US safety ; and the War Cheerleaders .

Those are the Chickenhawks : the ones who continually advocate the solving of our national Foreign policy problems using armed force .

The ones who suggest that the US is so strong , we can go it alone if we have to and we should n't be held back from attacking other countries by little things like , say , international conventions .

They advocate using maximum force to win ; their problem with the war in Iraq is that we are n't killing enough people over there , innocents included .

These people , who cheer on the deaths of others , who think that force is the best way to get what we want - but do n't sign up to serve themselves - are Chickenhawks .

They are too cowardly to put their ass on the line , but continually advocate that others do so .

These leeches and vultures are the ones getting rich off of the nation 's blood .

They stand safely back , saying , " Let 's you and them fight .

Me ? I 'll cheer you on , while me and my friends get rich off your efforts ."

There was a time when I strongly supported the invasion of Iraq , and it had nothing to do with presenting the good people of Iraq with a democratic form of government .

Yes , I would imagiane that Patrick Daniel Tillman most likely did n't need the $ when he enlisted but it is curious why Bush rendered the investigation of his death as a secret of national security .

The Chinese are going to stab us in the back . if we do n't turn away from Iraq and Afghanistan to rebuild @/@ recover our strength . Where they 're financially and militarily , bleeding us to death .

Fine , threaten to sell Aegis equipped ships to Taiwan if they do so .

If China were to do that , they would be cutting their own throats .

The LAST thing that China wants is a weak dollar because that would completely wipe out any chance of a trade surplus from their number one trading partner... the U.S.

A weak dollar means lots and lots of closed down factories in China because the Americans can n't afford their widgets and doohickies .

They will threaten , they will try to influence , but they won't ' drop the bomb ' unless they have a guarantee of some other country willing to buy several hundred billion dollars worth of junk a year .

After all , he 's the Decider , and Congress holds his trousers while he skinny dips .

Does America want us to lose this war and cut and run as Reid and Pelosi have impose upon our president ?

Does America want us to have to fight our way back in in six month or a year with a death toll in multiples of thousands over a radically less period of time ?

Also if we pull out of Iraq and go into Darfur what will be the justification for joining that war , WMD ?

Reid and Pelosi telling the government not to fight America 's war is like congress and the senate telling the government not to fight racism and the KKK a few decades back .

These cowardly democrats are bargaining that Americans will be stupid and not realize the deeper war that will have to be re @-@ fought in only a few short years .

Reid and Pelosi have been told this I am sure but they simply do n't care .

Answer : If the Most powerful army is already struggling in this war what will it be like when we pull out and come back in six months to a year ?

Reid and Pelosi stop trying to shove your partisan politics at our president over the generals " sound " military policies .

The blood of freedom is at stake and the very people who claim to value it are now our own worst enemies .

Also , rex , try to be civilized and dont resort to childish name calling .

Just because you feel passionately about this doesnt automatically mean that others will embrace your opinions .

OH YEH , AND , if you call me a coward again , Ill come up there to Jonesport , hunt you down , and buy you a drink first .

I 'm thinking Farmerman means what he says .

The day it becomes truly cowardly of one to suggest an end to mindless mayhem is the day I want to float off this planet .

His " handlers " are trying to cover ytracks and leave a legacy that is goona leve his presidency up there with Harding or Buchanan .

People like you have done more to screw this country up than " the democrats " could ever have hoped to do .

You repeatedly voted for and supported a president and an administration who was clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme .

You think that America means red , white , and blue and war and think nothing of shredding the constitution on the way to more blood and glory .

And you dare to presume that you are somehow the " real Americans " and the rest of us , those of us who actually know what the Constitution says and know what this ignoramus is trying to do to it , are somehow going to destroy " your " country .

You wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who can n't even run this country to somehow rebuild another , one that he did n't even begin to understand and had never been to .

You and your brethren , the Bush die @-@ hards , have sent this country in a death spiral .

And sadly , the only people we can have any hope of pulling us out are the " other party ".

A party that already was waning in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concepts too far is now supported by a majority of the public , and the beloved party of small government and individual liberties is now a hulking rusty heap of corruption , scandal , incompetence , special interests , big government , and domestic spying .

maybe I am , and maybe I 'm saying that you 're an idiot .

You mean SCUT FARKAS and his sidekick " toady " was Grover Dill , who was actually beaten up by Delbert Bumpus .

I need to set these things correct so that the record will be clear testimonyat Rex 's sanity hearing .

Most Christions I know will not bow to another God , no matter who that God is .

Thats why so many Christians were killed by the ancient Romans , they refused to bow down .

Also , to use an old cliche..." I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees "

I was reading in the paper today about all the laws under consideration that would make it harder for Americans to vote when I suddenly flashed on all the purple fingered Iraqi voters that were so celebrated in our press only a few short years ago .

I think I must be missing something because I 'm really confused by this .

Why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it 's citizens to vote ?

Conseratives figure ( and probably with justification ) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdles which might be thrown in their way .

Anything which makes voting more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voters going to the polls to vote for Democrats .

I do n't have a problem with the first two - provided that they make available photo IDs at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instructions and make it easy to obtain ( in other words - there are many locations to obtain and enough hours that are varied enough to get these ids ) .

I support having IDs to limit voter fraud , but you cannot make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an ID .

The Democrats must return to their progressive program , and must spend the resources necessary to remind the people that the GOP , the right wing , the Tea Party are just plain wrong on the issues .

What is interesting about the 2 party system is the people never actually vote FOR a party .

The net result is the people are misrepresented 100 % of the time - but amazingly they are so dumb they can n't figure it out .

We asked you : To save money , should local governments use nonviolent inmates for physical labor ?

So my qestion is this , should gov't turn to slaves to save money ?

he 's been here since 1955 and never did a thing to any one .

being a nazi was what was expected of germans back then .

you and i , had we lived there during that time , would probably have been in the same boat .

So I was discussing that new tv show on ABC , Commander in Chief , with my grandfather .

He made a comment that was interesting , he said , " That show is just the liberal media trying to get us used to the idea of a woman president for when Hillary runs ."

Now , my grandfather is one of those old , cynical guys that thinks that every sports game that does n't go his way is fixed , and is a tad racest , however , I found the statement intrigueing and made me wonder .

I 've definitely heard that argument before , and I refuse to watch the dang show .

Ok so I live in MI and maryjane was just legalized in our state .

Well all know why a state would legalize it , but do you really think that it can help somebody ? If so why ?

Think of any other drugs that you feel may help someone .

Think of this . When I was doing crystal , I was in school .

When I went to my classes tweaking , I paid more attention to what was going on in class .

I remember lookin at one of my report cards before I started using and my grades were either all d 's or d 's and f 's .

Then I looked at a report card that I got that had ALL a 's on it .

I was soo high on crystal that semester that I do not even remember most what happened at school or at home .

This does n't mean that I would go back and change things if I could , because I really do not want to .

@secondchance , I think that drugs can have positives but I think that they 'll rarely come without negatives and whether or not it 's a net positive is hard for anyone to tell , most of all the user .

For instance a couple of generations of artists have widely used drugs , convinced that the change in consciousness is of great help to their work .

We moderns have no doubt but that it is a good idea to drug people up on Ritalin and anti anxiety drugs and antidepressants , this highly drugged society has no basis to complain about weed and coke .

My life would be impoverished without my daily glass of wine .

I quite enjoyed the few joints I have tried .

And sometime , when I 'm in a better general mood than I am right now , I 'd like to try LSD or one of its relatives , maybe magic mushrooms .

To me , consuming drugs is a matter of moderation , not abstinence .

My wife has Constant ringing in her ears : noise , a " whooshing " as she describes .

She should see an otorhinolaryngologist ( ear specialist ; ear , nose and throat specialist ) as , if this is recent , there may be things they can do .

I just watched the most fascinating , inspiring , and yet heartbreaking documentary : The Half Ton Man .

Many people feel hungry every minute they are awake and fight the fact they know they are literally killing themselves with every bite they take .

Yet , when he reached 198 pounds he celebrated by having a hot dog , which turned into two , three , etc.

He now is morbidly obese again and is n't ready to go back into rehab at a center that has great success in helping these people .

When I was younger I could eat virtually anything and not gain weight .

I 'm almost 52 and it 's not quite that easy for me to keep my weight to what is comfortable for me .

I am able to do it , but watching this video scared me . One woman in the video was actually eight feet wide when she got help .

I have seen shows on TV where two year old children weigh nearly 200 pounds all because their parents want to appease the child and stop their fussing .

Does anyone out there have a big problem with their weight ?

I think the problem and cure is psychological . They should spend more time on the psycology of it coupled with the surgery .

Besides the obvious medical issues with him , I was disturbed by the co @-@ dependant relationship with his wife .

At his worst , he weighed 1,072 pounds .

He was unable to even roll over in bed , let alone get to the refrigerator or supermarket....

he could n't even get to a phone or a computer to order food if you put it 10 feet away from him .

She feels she 's showing love by bringing him to deaths door because he asked for ( or begged or ranted ) for food .

Also , in the video , after he had gotten under 500 pounds , Patrick said " I avoid foods with a lot of fat and sodium "....as he was snacking on individual size bags on salted nuts and potato chips .

In the scene before that ( after his gastic bypass and much weight loss ) , the wife brought him dinner....Kentucky Fried Chicken .

" Oh ", she said , " Here 's your protein ", as she waved an extra crispy drumstick at him .

When I make it , I through out 4 out of the 12 yolks , and mix in a pound of tofu....he never knows the difference .

( BTW , he 's very thin , but has a heart condition ) .

Doctors have told me I have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze .

Any tips , suggestions , etc. , about what to expect during first few days , how to manage , sleep , any info .

I had suffered low grade " bursitis " in one shoulder for many years ( probably a worn rotator cuff ) , until one day while working out I got a real , full tear .

My surgery was successful , but it took me several months to regain my range of motion in the shoulder .

I was determined to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine , so I in effect took charge of the rehab program and made it clear to the therapist the Orthopedic Surgeon that I would n't accept less .

In retrospect I believe this was the critical thing , in that the Docs . and the therapists take their cues from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery , they will let you go .

If you are determined to go on , they will help .

I have full use of the shoulder and no more pain .

I hope this is helpful and wish you good luck !

I 'm under erratic , severe stress in my personal life and my colorful , efficient adrenalin glands are playing merry hell with my blood pressure .

I 'm hoping to avoid drugs by losing weight and learning serenity , but meanwhile I 'm supposed to monitor my blood pressure at home .

Then after 7 years of faithful service , it up and died .

These only work about 20 % of the time and dealing with them sends my blood pressure up to new heights .

Also , because of a lumpectomy I can only use my left arm for B.P. readings .

I 'm left handed , but am making progress in non @-@ dominent @-@ hand dexterity .

Noddy , from your post I assume you have not checked on the models currently on the market .

Most companies have fully automatic models that do n't require adjusting it to your arm with every use .

You adjust it once to fit your arm ( You can do this with it off your arm ; it might take two tries ) and that 's that .

Slip it on your arm . Press a button and in less than a minute read your B.P. and heart rate .

I 've had an Omron for three years and have never had a problem .

You can get them a bit cheaper if you are willing to pump it up yourself .

As I sit here foggy headed and lets face it with most of the symptoms of hypoglycemia I thought I should do something about it .

Im trying to start to eat healthily , slowly but surely , which means cutting out processed foods and eating more natural things .

A good start to begin with but not necessarily dealing with hypoglycemia .

It says give up things like caffiene , tobacco , things I dont consume anyway , it says give up wheat , which is bread , which I tend to eat alot of .

Basically does anybody have any advice on what to eat or recomend a good book ?

Search out a glycemia index , and determine something both edible and low on the list .

Add that to your diet , to avoid getting into hypoglycemia .

i have not yet been diagnosed but i am beginning to suspect hypoglycemia @/@ low blood sugar .

lately i have been very confused , have anxiety , dizziness , fatigued , weak , depressed , and generally low .

i know i need to gain more weight - i lost about 20 pounds suddenly about 6 months ago and have n't been able to gain it back .

I have not seen any material as to why the 50+ population is unsuitable for this vaccine .

Well , according to that FDA link children between 5 and 17 are the most likely to actually get the flu itself and it looks like that was the intended target age group for the development of FluMist .

They note that it is 87 % effective in preventing people in that range from getting the flu at all but people in the 18 @-@ 49 range only had lessened symptoms .

It is inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wrecks havoc on your health in such a profound way but that is the case .

I " was " taking a Centrum multivitamin once a day as suggested on the back label and I was waking up with dry mouth so sever I could not even swallow .

My skin was getting scaly , my eyes burning and my feet were so dry they begin to develop calluses and crack .

I stopped my vitamin and it is now gone .

If you search the internet for " dry mouth and multivitamin " you get this idiot named " Jade M " on Google answers that replies that it is " not likely " that a multivitamin is causing this dryness of nearly every cell in the body .

Sorry to say Jade M whoever you are but you are WRONG...

If you do n't know what you are talking about you should n't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum .

My sister is a nurse at a veterans hospital and she complained to her doctor that she was getting dry mouth .

He told her that it was her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely .

A friend of mine who takes many medications for his heart just came up to me and told me he was getting terrible dry mouth at night and reduced his multivitamin to only a few times a week and now no more dry mouth .

In other words if you follow the directions on the back label of your vitamins they will start slowly killing you .

Do n't expect Paul G. Donohue M.D.to help you either .

He basically dismisses this elderly persons claim then tries to get her to take corrective medications .

I get dry mouth too plus my skin gets dry and scaly and when I stop my multivitamin it immediately goes away .

Not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we cannot trust people who have PHD credentials giving their advice online .

What do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ails us ?

When my sister told this to me I did not really give it much thought .

Then I permanently lost 10 % of my eyesight due to dry eyes .

Then my mouth chronically became dry , skin kept piling up on my feet that I could n't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it , the skin on my hands became scaly and my lips kept cracking and my tongue felt like it had pins and needles poking into it .

I stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptoms are gone , sadly my eyesight is still damaged .

I should have just listened to my sister rather than err , Jade M.

My doctor was even prescribing fish oil supplements to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problems being caused by my multivitamin .

I do n't consume a lot of salt in my diet and I am on no other medications or drugs whatsoever .

If you are experiencing dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly .

Take it only a few times a week , if that , and you will realize the vitamins cause this .

I was also told by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants , a person gets what they need from their diet of most minerals and do not require a multivitamin at all .

Please weigh in on this , sorry I am upset about this but I am also troubled now by internet advice that is clearly WRONG about this issue and no telling how many others .

Also if you are feeding your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too .

Even children should only be given a multivitamin a few times a week and not every day .

Take it from me who has experienced this first hand , my sister who is a nurse , my friend taking many meds whose dry mouth stopped the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and L.F who was incorrectly advised by , err , Donehue .

It is a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctors , health specialists and the internet are so out of the loop .

I forget what my sister said was causing this , I seem to recall zinc , but I may be wrong about that .

Consider if it is visibly destroying your skin it is also destroying your major organs too .

Please comment and offer any further advice on this subject .

I just started on a new kind of multivitamin and my body 's been all kinds of crazy .

I used to just take specific vitamins but that got expensive and elaborate and I was missing some things so I switched to a multi .

The multi has calcium and I know from previous experience that calcium tears my stomach up .

I 'm getting older and I know that I need some calcium though .

I do n't have dry mouth but I agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequences .

I have to constantly make such comparisons to make sure it all works .

I am on very high dose vitamin C , besides my green multiple , that is very concentrated compared top wimpy Centrum .

I never had dry mouth until this high dose of C , so I am assuming it is the C.

I use it as an antihistamine to control my IBS .

I have overactive mast cells that start pulling water into my gut when i run out of C and Magnesium ( this I think was caused by taking a round of vaccines in 2003 , and the studies I found online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increased histamine production ) .

So I am on 4000 @-@ 6000 mg of C 4X daily and 400 @-@ 600 mg Magnesium 4 x Daily .

This is a lot , but I have learned it does control my bowels .

This is ultimately an adrenal issue , as the adrenals are throwing out huge amounts of electrolytes and I am sure other stuff , so until I realized this I was in constant loose bowels losing my nutrients .

But it HAS caused dry mouth .

I do n't think it is as bad as some I have read here .

According to this , American citizens can now be arrested and detained indefinitely without trial .

Does that mean that anyone can be taken and put into a hole forever without justification ?

But who decides that the person was actually a member of or working for Al Qaeda ?

The judge would not let him be released until sentencing either .

The judge said his behavior was wreckless and the community could be in harm 's way . ( Not his exact words ) .

I am glad he is losing his license .

No matter what , he never should have given Michael Jackson that propofol .

The local ABC channel featured a legal expert who derided the trial , calling it a travesty , making doctors afraid to treat patients and so forth .

An increasing proportion of US children are so severely obese as to be at immediate risk for life @-@ threatening complications including type 2 diabetes .

Ultimately , government can reduce the need for such interventions through investments in the social infrastructure and policies to improve diet and promote physical activity among children .

Severe obesity in children -- is that a form of child abuse ?

Should the state step in and save these kids from their parents ?

David... you 're so not looking at the big picture .

Considering that we are globally competing against India and China who so far DO N'T suffer this epidemic , we will fall farther behind in almost every aspect .

Prevention is needed now not later when it will most likely NOT work .

Cheaper to fix it now then to let it cripple the entire economy at a later date .

I live in CA and I signed an affiliation agreement 12 @/@ 09 which states that I was to pay a monthly fee to the owners .

The owners said " NOT " to pay until my business had picked up .

Although my business is struggling , I have tried several times to start paying this fee .

We have now parted ways , for both personal and professional reasons , and now they are taking me to small claims court for the affiliation fee they said I did n't have to pay plus their legal fees ( I am being bullied ) .

I thought a verbal agreement would override a written agreement , but is that hard to prove ?

I mean obviously the proof is that they are suing me for back fees that I have not been paying because business has been slow .

Please , help or share your story .

It sounds like they were waiving certain fees , with the understanding that you were going to stay for the long haul .

If you left early , then they now want all their fees .

You should have put the money is escrow if you felt uncomfortable with the arrangement .

( I did n't want to post the photos because they are really gross.)

Most of these people are charged with animal abuse and neglect and they are fined and jailed .

i watched animal planet ( way too late at night this weekend ) and saw a florida animal cops .

They busted a hoarder with 82 dogs and confiscated 78 of them ( i think legally in fla you can have 4 ) .

The dogs were in such bad shape , some could n't walk because their nails were so long , most were flea infested and had been sleeping in their own feces .

there were two sets of puppies in the house and as they panned around the house , it appeared that there were at least two other sets of puppies in the making .

the woman was not prosecuted as long as she was willing to give up the amount needed to take her back to the legal limit .

apparently the media ran a story about it and over 40 dogs were adopted the first day they were available .

i go for mentally ill as well , but like freeduck said , sometimes the only way to get them treatment is to prosecute .

They just told this woman they would keep checking up on her ( randomly so she could n't hide pets like she was when they were rounding them up ) and as long as she had only 4 , she was fine .

that seems reasonable to me since no dogs were dead , no dogs were starving , they just needed more attention .

now those people should be tied to a tree with no food and water and see how they do...

We had our own local " cat lady " who made the newspaper headlines a couple of decades ago .

Many people tried to help her , but she made it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of having her home condemned .

Her house was declared a public nuisance and the city tore it down .

She was wearing a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hairs sticking out .

I think it is a kind of depression myself , where one lets go of a lot of effort to keep up with daily life except to ' care ' for animals , and then is overwhelmed but sees no way out of it - except that they do , I gather , start again .

Not that I do n't want them stopped .

There is something to be said for humane institutional care , and I am not talking about the dogs .

Please - this is NOT a thread about the case , as such , I find those threads concerning - BUT about some of the differences between the American , and some other countries ' practices - and their effect .

For instance : i ) In Australia , and , I believe , Great Britain at the very least , the name of a juvenile involved in a criminal matter is not revealed , whether they be alleged victim , or alleged perpetrator , except in very special circumstances

( eg they have been kidnapped , and police seek public help to find them - or they have been murdered - or if they are alleged to have committed a very serious crime and are being tried as adults , or if it is in some way in the public interest.)

To these non @-@ US eyes , it is very shocking to see the name and photograph of the young man alleged to have been abused by Jackson splashed all over the media -

here , juveniles are protected to the point that , on the few occasions I have accompanied a minor who was raped or sexually abused to court , while she @/@ he gave testimony - if the offender ( these were cases where , oddly , a conviction was obtained , so I do not say " alleged " offender ) was also a minor , it was a big deal to be allowed in to be a support person for the victim , because I would hear the name of the offender .

Occasionally , with high profile cases , the police will " leak " things - and @/@ or the media will attempt , within the letter of the law , to try a case in the media ( the Lindy Chamberlain case was a terrible example of both these occurrences ) -

but the organised propaganda campaigns that I think I detect in the US are not generally present .

iii ) This is unrelated - but , do people think this is going to be another black v white case , and do you think that high profile non @-@ Caucasian people still - despite their wealth and power - are unfairly treated in the US justice system ?

I would think that , similarly to here , that poorer and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but I am interested in views re people who have achievedfame and fortune .

I 've served on jury duty several times and came away highly impressed with how seriously everybody took their various responsibilities .

I 'm trying to pay as little attention to this case as possible , because I think it 's more a freak show than anything else .

The person charged often cannot be identified , as their name , and the details of the relationship to the child , would mean the child could possibly be identified .

Sleeping next to the elephant means we 've probably become a bit jaded to the circus . But the laws are much tighter here .

I would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment , D'Artagnan ! !!! But - it is ALLOWED to happen !

I guess what I am getting at is the different LAWS on such matters...

We seem much more like you guys - but , I suppose , the US invented its laws after a revolution - we inherited them after centuries of slow evolution with no cataclysm , and made changes slowly .

I think but I 'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in Canada without the express permission of the victim .

You cannot print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime , except in very special @/@ rare circumstances where a minor is at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves .

I have seen pictures of his previous victim which I though was pretty appalling but generally the faces have been smudged out .

What I hope will happen here is that people will come along to present the case FOR allowing the names to be made public , because it is incomprehensible to me -

It is n't as though people in the US are not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason...

I think they are getting ready to bring the first miner up .

On CNN I saw a picture they showed of the faces of the miners , and I saw at least a couple guys that look way too big to fit in that thing .

I guess they 'll be sucking in their guts .

I guess the whole rescue is supposed to take about two days , if their estimates are correct and nothing goes wrong .

Here 's a place where there are some livestreams if you want to check it out .

They came together to support and save the miners ' lives .

The last man , one of the rescuers , must be able to lock the rescue tube 's door correctly from the inside ?

I can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devises , but I can n't figure out how he can lock the door so it does n't come loose if no one is there to do it from the outside .

he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord held on the inside .

Looks like these guys are gonna get out in time to do their Christmas Shopping

You can n't stop riding without thinking about riding later...

Here I am , and how do I get out..

You know what David is going to tell you in a few minutes : if the others had guns to protect themselves , they all would be dead by now .

my " enlightened " solution is for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they are able to harm anyone .

I 'm talking specifically about the showing of the contents of the package that he sent to NBC .

I realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway , and that the public really REALLY wants to see what was in that package , but is n't it also in a way glorifying @/@ validating the guy 's actions and giving him exactly what he wanted ?

For instance , the image of him pointing a gun at the camera is on just about every news site I see online , and the video clips of his rantings are starting to show up everywhere as well . And his writing .

I realize how fascinating it is to try to get inside this nutball 's head , but is there any way to put the news out there about him without giving him rock star status ?

He stage @-@ managed this -- he wanted the badass stuff out there , he wanted that lasting image .

The rest is unnecessary , and articles BBB and nimh have linked to argue convincingly that the propaganda is downright dangerous .

The American public has reached the point in our culture , that the news that gets the most coverage is the news that plays to the lowest common denominator amongst us .

Think about it . For weeks , there was Pamela Anderson and the baby . Then it was Don Imus . Now all we hear about is that murderous nutjob who acted on his sickest delusions .

It is like the newspapers and TV want to beat out the supermarket rags . Ugh !

I 've been enjoying the NYTimes blog , primarily by Michael Kimmelman , who I 'm used to reading when he writes about art.

But he 's joined by several other good writers who are apparently hanging around the US Open typing away as they feel like it .

Have always like Vecsey 's writing , but can n't read him in the paper lately because he 's now in the Times Select group that you have to pay for to get access to , even on the day of the article .

My favorite writer on the blog is Kimmelman , he seems to have my eyes , if I had his .

I 'm enjoying the play by play , as it were , so much that I want to see if I can go back and read the blog on the World Cup .

I do follow international tennis -- one of the first things I want to glance over on the morning newspaper .

If she did n't have it in her heyday , she 's not going to have it now in the twilight of her career .

I have a question for anyone who feels that want to answer .

I have been watching a bit of ' Rhythmic Gymnastics ' on YouTube...I just find it amazing...it 's very cool .

I do n't have children , but when I get to that stage , I 'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport .

My question though is , is it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age is nice , at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all ?

If it is true , I 'd prefer not to have any part in it , but if it 's not true , it would be great to know .

Thanks for you quick reply .

Could it be that different people react to it in different ways ?

Maybe you just enjoy it while you do , and if you find it painful afterwards...bad luck , if not...GREAT !

I 'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics , but I know both gymnasts and dancers are prone to on @-@ the @-@ job injury -- and the effects of those injuries can add up .

The behaviour of Australian cricket fans is of more concern than the thousands of spirited Barmy Army members set to descend upon our shores for this summer 's Ashes series , say Victoria 's police .

The number of English fans travelling to Australia is expected to easily surpass the 10,000 who came for the 2002 @-@ 03 Ashes series because of last year 's victory and because of an online ticketing fiasco that saw thousands of English fans nabbing Ashes tickets meant for Australians .

Apparently the Aussies ( a devious lot ) have said that when they win the series ( that 's IF they do , but they do n't think that way ) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at Lord 's Cricket Ground back to Oz .

MCC say , on your bikes Cobber , because that urn is a gift , not a trophy , and it stays where it is .

I 'm sitting here pulling my hair out because my roomate is watching the Masters on TV . I 'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf .

While semi @-@ watching , I just realized something : while the golfer is setting up his shot , and about to swing , all the fans get very quiet for them . Then I thought about fans at sports games( golf is n't a sporting event , it 's a hobby ) , and they scream , yell , and do their best to annoy the opposing team 's players and throw them off their game .

This made me just hate watching golf on TV even more .

Walk , and carry your bloody clubs .

so there are others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport ? thats wonderful !

tennis players get the same ' silent treatment ' from spectators -- not exactly sure why...

One other thing that must annoy you . In all other sports ( yeah , golf is a sport ) ...there are refs and umps and all that . And the people playing the sports argue with those officials all the time .

In golf...you gotta call fouls on yourself . And golfers do !

It 's looking like he is out for the year , though depedning on his rehabilitation , he may try to be available for the playoffs .

I do n't think he 's willing to let the previous season 's Super Bowl be his last .

Or it is possible you will stand there with a frozen grin on your face , unable to say anything remotely intelligent .

Several of us A2K'ers have created a support group to painlessly guide you towards appearing knowledgeable even if , like many of us , you are clueless .

You will need to invest a grand total of 7 minutes . Total . Max .

Please indicate , by noon on Saturday , Jan 8 th , your picks on these 4 games :

The Jets aggravated me no end in Fantasy Football ( Sanchez was my quarterback ) , so this seems to me a perfectly good reason to pick the Colts , who also aggravated me , but not as much .

I 'm placing my faith that the Jet 's defense will kick in one more time .

Besides this wild card round is just fodder for the real games when the Patriots start playing and ultimately take the whole burrito , ( enchiladas are n't classy enough for Tom Brady and the gang ) .

Instead of a coin toss - and because I know absolutely nothing about football @- I 'm going to do it by which city I know @/@ like better and see how well I do .

Just as an experiment to begin with , but I am fairly competititive in spirit , so if one of my teams makes it to the Super Bowl - I 'll watch it instead of the Andy Griffith show marathon and eat me some chicken wings and drink a beer or two .

in an article in toronto 's " globe and mail " newspaper , John Polanyi , a Nobel laureate and member of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Toronto , recommends that afghanistan farmers be allowed( you might even say " be encouraged ") to grow poppies ( opium ) legally .

i saw the interview he gave on CBC @-@ TV recently and he seems to know what he is talking about .

as he put it : " the afghan farmer has to make a living to feed his - often large - family .

we can force him to produce the poppies illegally and feed into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppies from him and help provide pain @-@ killing drugs ."

as i posted sometime ago , countries such as :france , australia and india are permitted to grow poppies legally for the production of drugs - why not allow the afghan farmers the same privilege ?

have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not .

Unfortunately , the product of the papver somniferum plant has far more monetary value on the black market than when sold to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers .

The criminal element that currently buy the crop are still going to try and get their hands on it , so the crops would need to be guarded .

That 's going to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed .

The future of the news reality shows , or whatever should one call it .

Kevin Sites touring the world 's conflict zones with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit images and videos from war ridden areas daily .

One can contact him there , or chat with him live on the website .

Now while I know he 's doing it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money , I have to say I find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning .

Will it start a new wave of journalists seeking out the most dangerous situations to sell their goods ?

And will that encourage the sides in conflict to up their performance , so to speak , getting international live coverage straight from the front ?

Anyway , I 'm confused about how I feel about it .

I will surely look in often to see where he 's at and will be curious about the reports and live videos .

gus , that 's what 's making me uncomfortable .

but i won't deny that i am also curious , although it makes me feel kinda dirty .

If they make money good for them !

If they survive many of these men come back home changed , and sometimes not for the better .

They could also come back wounded or sick .

To me , it 's a good thing to be able to choose how your going to die when it 's for a good cause .

Of course , I imagine he 'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sorts .

The UN or at least some of the members threaten sanctions .

Sanctions , what sanctions could the UN impose , refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry " OIL "?

Iraq could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof .

It 's blowing smoke as it 's the people who will end up suffering from any such move .

If the UN really wants to make a difference , they could threaten to pass a resolution ! !!!!

Ooooooh ! That ought to scare ' em...."

Does he , I wonder , think that would be his excuse to invade .

Let me start by saying that I love Morocco .

I 've been there a few times in the last 6 or 7 years and have become familiar with its people and customs and geography and unique challenges .

Each time I 've visited , I 've noticed immense , fast @-@ paced progress , both economically and socially .

Since my first visit there a network of well @-@ built highways has been built , enabling european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish .

I 've witnessed cell phones come on the market and virtually explode .

Agricultural technology has taken off and enabled farmers to be profitable and efficient , as well as increasing the availability of affordable food to all Moroccans .

My aim for this thread is to periodically discuss new developments and economic initiatives in Morocco as they come about in the news , as well as any other news that is deemed curious or interesting .

I know there are some cells there of folks who want to cause havoc but that is presumably not the whole population .

At the least , I am interested in hearing more about it .

Don , could you be more specific about why Morocco is to be avoided ?

This all reminds me of myself sitting at a train station in italy at about 5 @:@ 30 a.m . one morning .

My husband and I wandered in after buying our train tickets to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride... and shared a table with two tourists from the US .

My xhub and the tourers were talking away about something and I glanced over at the ( moroccans ) and we started talking in poor italian , which is how I found out they were from Morocco .

Very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation.. I turned to the others and the lady said , " dear , you musn't talk with them , they are dangerous ."

I can n't remember what I said , but it was short , succinct .

Not every immigrant from far away lands is the devil in disguise , and neither are all of us .

Well said , JLN !

I have n't been there myself but my 3 sons and a friend went a couple of years ago .

They said a ) it was one of the most beautiful places they had been and b ) it was the place in the world they had been most hassled and cheated .

They said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated .

One thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable ( a nwe word and it 's only 9 am ! ) .

My eldest who is especially friendly and tolerant tried to make friends with these people but in the end they all wanted something .

That can be dispiriting for the open @-@ minded and open @-@ hearted .

But they enjoyed their stay generally , would certainly not avoid it in future .

As for lumping all Islamic countries together as a no go area - what complete nonsense !

As we 're going to Turkey and Syria at the end of this month , and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent travellers , I am definitely making a political statement -

I do NOT lump all Muslims together , and believe that 98 % are friendly to travellers .

Most are undoubtedly anti @-@ American and anti @-@ Bush , but that is not a sentiment confined to the Islamists .

My engagement ring @/@ wedding ring and other personal ring along with my husband 's wedding ring was stolen .

We went camping and put them together in the car .

After camping and coming home we searched high and low and could not find them .

We called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything .

So we had to assume some one stole them .

Sounds funny now , but at the time I felt very violated at the thought of strangers going through my house .

Yes I can say the one thing was at least it was n't in my house .

The idea of some one going through your house is as bad as them taking Christmas presents .

Wow , the Afghanis are in for a life @-@ changing shock to their culture and way of life .

Will China and Russia now side with the Taliban to take over the country and exploit the riches ?

Will the US help the Afghani people to learn from our mistakes and protect their natural environment from strip mining ?

Will Al Queda now return to the country to enrich themselves with the profits ?

Will the lithium deposits take away from efforts by Al Gore and others to invest in and invent research and development in improved battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the U.S ?

I dont think that any vast deposits found in one land that barely exists as a state and has almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of TAliban takeover of provinces within which are these deposits .

SInce much of it lies in the mountainous regions of the West and southwest , these are already the subject of the new campaign against a resurfacing TAliban .

These minerals , especially the Lithium , will need major processing before its in a commercial state for batteries .

If they found deposits of rhodium and platinum itd be a major reason to enter negotiations to help em develop their resources .

You can have all the rear metals in the world in your country , but the supporting infrastructer 's must be in place , I.E. roads , power plants , process facilties , WATER , tons and tons of WATER , chemical suppliers , etc.

The Administrative and Legislative branches of our government can n't agree on how to make a dent in our deficits .

Go on vacation for a month and appoint a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives to try to work out some sort of plan .

They must come up with a plan by Thanksgiving - roughly 100 days - that 7 of the 12 members can agree on .

If they succeed , their plan must pass the House and the Senate with no alterations .

I , too , am skeptical , edgar .

The 3 Dems and 3 Repubs from the House seem to be intractably committed to their parties ' more extreme wings .

We will have to see .

In the meantime , if any of you find biographies of the 12 members of the super committee , please link or write your own profile of them .

I 've said elsewhere that I do n't think they 're expected to accomplish anything .

They may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other .

The triggers were specifically chosen because each one is desirable to one party and not anethema to the other .

It never was a good idea and only seemed to be a good idea to the morons .

There was never any reason to think that this was going to work , and now that it will not they are going to try to defuse the trigger...but THAT might not work either .

I dont know what the Vegas odds of gutting the defense department is but I put it at around 30 % .

It was always going to happen at some point , but maybe 10 @-@ 20 years down the line , not now .

If this happens it will be a major breaking of faith with the American people .

Millions of Americans went to war for America , and came back broken or otherwise gave up a lot , and now we look to take a huge chunk of their hide because Washington no longer works .

EDIT : " delay and pray " has not worked in Europe , and it will not work in America .

In both places we see from our so called leaders a massive refusal to step up to the plate .

The reason we are fighting the worlds wars is because the very rich who dont want to pay their share of taxes want the protection of the government for the wealth and jobs they have imported to other countries .

What the majority of the U.S citizens get in return is nothing but a lack of jobs and a reduction in our ability to feed our families .

Time to plug yourself in for a recharge , youre starting to run down .

If you wanna defeat Obama , seems to me you need a candidate with something between their ears .

All I see is Bozo and friends on the GOP side .

( Hint : Id vote for a republican if one of substance showed up , Im not too thrilled with the job Obama did .

I think he wasted his capital on the health care right at the beginning of the worst economic situation weve seen in our lifetimes .

UNFORTUNATELY , you cannot really think that any of the present gaggle of GOP candidates have got substance ) .

Thus the analysis that I have put up on A2K in multiple places that the US Federal Government is corrupt , and is run by the corporate class .

We see the oppression of the people by the government in other areas besides economics though , for instance I have pointed out how this oppression is woven onto our sex law .

The oppressors should not get too comfy , as oppressors the world over are finding out they get over thrown by force of public will .

Where is Theodore " Teddy " Roosevelt when we need him --- again ?

The greatest irony I 've seen here at a2k Hawkeye is although I agree with on the statement that the US is an oligarchy or a plutocracy I believe you have foolishly drunk the Kool @-@ Aid to think the Tea Party is genuine in it 's pursuit to save the country from " our oppressors " when EVERY move they propose is a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo .

Clearly you are too blinded by your personal selfishness and greed to see and feel the rain falling on your head from your Tea Party overlords .

Progressive governments exist and should continue to exist in order to protect it 's citizens from the raiding and looting hordes of the multibillion dollar conglomerates and banking institutions who themselves exist in order to set up a select small population into extreme wealth and power .

I am not of the Tea Party , I am a radical leftist formerly a revolutionary currently a socialist .

I strongly support libertarian political actions because I want to see individuals once again free enough from government oppresion that they can choose to come together in collective effort .

What we have now is a sham socialism impossed by a government which is owned by the coporate class , whos only mission is to grab more wealth .

Now if we can free ourselves from our billion dollar overlords perhaps we can enjoy real freedom and get rid of our bought politicians .

The Euro countries are afraid to let Greece go bankrupt , because it will be followed by Spain and Ireland .

The European Central Banks Euro policies continue to exacerbate the problems for Greece and the other Euro countries with huge deficits .

France and Germany are trying their best to prop up Greece with more loans and forgiving of loans , but that seems like a losing proposition when Greece really does n't have an economy that can pay back the loans they already have .

It seems like desperation times for the Euro zone countries , but the majority are in no position to assist Greece with their growing deficit .

Germany and France are in no position to save all of them when the water 's rush gets stronger by the month ( growing deficits ) .

Rather like an individual who works hard , produces useful work , and saves for the future suddenly finding himself wiped out because of the acts of a central bank , somewhere .

There was pent up demand for everything after the war , because most civilians earned money building our war machines for four years , and there was hardly any consumer goods to buy .

What was " funny " to some degree was the " cheap " junk we imported from Japan , because Americans were ready to spend money .

A bush league president and political party should never be near the steering wheel of the US economy .

Their reckless policies and ideology can only lead backwards to a 18 th or 19 th century society of robber barons and ideological cutthroats .

It 's too late ; we 've been a recession many months ago ; most families could not continue to live their lifestyles of a couple of years ago because food and fuel costs have increased to the point most could not keep up with those higher costs .

As family members lost their jobs and homes , many also lost their health insurance .

You can listen to our government about " not being in a recession , " but I see it different .

Australia takes on SL ( or rather Australian spectators take on Murali ) ; India sweats it out with Pakistan ; SA prepare to face NZ .

Would the Ozzies and Indians ( British are allowed , too ) want to talk over a beer or two ?

AUSTRALIAN rock legend Billy Thorpe has died this morning after suffering a major heart attack overnight .

Thorpe , 60 , died in the early hours of the morning after he was rushed to Sydney 's St Vincent 's Public Hospital at 2 am ( AEDT ) , a spokesman has said .

Children of the Sun was released in 1979 Top twenty .

Billy headlined his own sold out tours through 1979 and 80 .

Lived as fast as he died .

After strategically ' excising ' bits of Australia in order to thwart people smugglers ( you can n't land in Australia if we pass a law to say it IS N'T Australia this week ) , our pint @-@ sized PM has decided to think big .

The Govt is planning to create a ' security zone ' that extends 1,000 nautical miles around the country .

This would allow the monitoring and possible interception of any vessel within the zone .

This Govt has also repeatadly said that it will take independent action to pre @-@ emptively strike at ' terror ' and we are sourcing suppliers of cruise missiles .

Of course they just HAPPEN to be the most populous Muslim nation on Earth - of course we should always walk tall and talk tough when dealing with them .

Could you imagine how tough Washington would be if there was the ' Islamic Republic of Canada ' with a billion or more people sitting on their northern border ?

They would have invaded us long ago if there was n't a big stretch of ocean in between .

If I were to describe accurately and succinctly my estimation of that post , australia , I might be banned .

I shall content myself by simply saying that you are utterly ignorant of where Stilly might have been , and what his experiences or feelings might be , nor do I see his whereabouts as forming the basis of any rational argument .

Perhaps fortunately , however , you have made no attempt to formulate any such argument .

They did approve assisted suicide , but I think voted against every other ' liberal ' proposal .

I honestly think the pendulum is beginning to swing back from the far left .

Once the traditional marriage is safe , then I am confident the people will get busy to provide a way for gay couples to enjoy the same protections as married people do , and I think that will pass with scarcely more than a murmor .

I love when those that do n't get it claim there can n't be global warming cause it 's 8 degrees and theres 3 feet of snow on the ground .

What is the benefit of denying that it is happening or accepting that it is possible ?

Ambergris is used in perfumes or as a perfume .

I thought it was a type of amber ( a tree resin product ) , but it is totally unrelated .

You know how hawks and coyotes vomit up the undigestible parts of their food ?

The stuff the eject is fould and gross , but after it floats in the sun , on the ocean , for many years , it becomes ambergris - worth a small fortune too.....

There was nothing the 19 th century whalers prized more highly -- a good haul of ambergris could allow all the ships officers to retire , or buy their own ships -- and allow the sailors to get famously drunk , until they were robbed and went lookin ' for a new berth...

Imagine breaking open a chunk of a ambergris and discovering something like that...

( If they kill one for it , if they get anything at all they 'll some foul @-@ smelling bile that has to be floated on the sea for 10 years or more...)

It is considered to be a floating ecosystem , sort of a microcosm of a rain forest , and every time one is destroyed scientists lose valuable information that might have been used for discovering a cure for cancer or some other dealdly malady .

Obama dramatically escalated the extrajudicial killings by America around the world ( mainly in Yemen , Pakistan and Afghanistan ) since taking office .

He more than doubled his own increased rate .

Obama is sending out these drones to kill people at a rate of once every 4 days .

We 've made a new generation of enemies in Pakistan and Afghanistan for these assassinations ( and the " night raids " Obama escalated in Afghanistan ) .

Why can Obama , the greatest drone murderer in history , get away with it with hardly a word about it ?

He even gets away with cracking jokes about predator drones while I know damn well that most of you here would have excoriated Bush for something like that .

Do you all just not know that Obama has escalated the killings done in your name or do you just not care anymore ?

When you go on a crusade you do n't pull any punches with your headlines , do you , Robert ?

I stated long ago that I no longer support him .

I will vote third party , if at all , since neither major party wants to nominate somebody with my values .

I see your point , which you made well on the other thread .

I had a discussion a week or so ago with a old lib friend thinking about voting for Ron Paul , and I went on about my old theory about watching for the company someone keeps .

That 's from my hematology days , when if you find a blast cell in a peripheral smear , it was very likely a progenitor of the cells around it , thus helping identify the leukemia .

Thus , I might like a Republican , but would worry about the administration that came along with him or her .

I ended with saying I 'm not all so happy about the " company Obama keeps " either .

I convinced her , but my conviction on this is shallow .

She and I are both in despair about Obama for reasons already well discussed on a2k re his get along mode .

I 'm not sure she is as troubled by U.S. actions around the world as I am , but I think so .

I 'm interested in third party mavericks , but have trouble envisioning how that would work out even if I approved of the candidate .

Given a Republican in office , one of those in the present batch of candidates , I have more trouble not seeing things get worse in some ugly ways re the economy and how life would work for the struggling with little income .

You sound like you 'd rather see that than put up with Dem mediocrity any further .

On that , I both see your point and am not there yet myself .

Why , I 'll say I fear things being worse ( to me ) for a while might spiral out of control .

Here 's a funny one : when I got a job working for the local college I had to show my birth certificate before they would hire me .

Mine had been mislaid and I 'd asked if there was any way I could work in lieu of finding it , but they said : no they would not hire me without a birth certificate .

But Barack Obama has yet to produce a valid birth certificate and is no president of the United States .

Not only does it take less paperwork to become president of the United States than a tutor at a local college , but the US constitution requires the President must be a natural born citizen !

Without requiring proof of birth we have waived this constitutional requirement .

@Muarck , Note : this is not conservative or republican agenda .

Who are you trying to fool ?

A certified copy of a birth certificate issued by the state of birth is valid legal proof of birth , acceptable in a court of law .

Those always stay on file in wherever the state keeps their vital records .

It 's been examined several times and declared valid .

CNN has both Missouri and NC at " 100 % reporting " but they 're still not colored in .

I am not unhappy but I am shocked .

I 've been threatened physically twice....like I give a shit....

I do tend to stir the pot I realize .

Last night at my gig some drunks late night were discussing what to call Obama...bandying the usual right wing talk around and I said " I suggest you call him the motherfucking President Elect ".

He was n't sure what to say in response to that so he paid his tab and left

After last night 's events in Brussels , it 's clear that the UK does n't want to be a part of the Europe ( or just the EU ? ) anymore .

@Walter Hinteler , I can n't remember where I read the analysis , but the conclusion which made sense to me was that currency boundaries ultimately implied federal boundaries .

To be anthropomorphic , the " UK psyche " resists federal union with Europe as evidenced by their original reluctance to join the Eurozone .

Ever crucial issue is put up for a plebecite , or a vote by nation -- and the population of one or more countries , or the governments of one of more countries , torpedo the deal .

Not too long ago , when Barack Obama campaigned for the presidency , he was all about human rights .

Time and time again , Obama emphasized ( and I 'm quoting from memory here ) that under his rule America would n't lead the world through the example of its power , but through the power of its example .

Last week , the Obama administration had a perfect opportunity to act on its rhetoric , to set an example of America 's new spirit , to specifically deliver “ change we can believe in ”.

When the CIA suspects people of connections to terrorism , it snatches them off the streets wherever they live , flies them to those secret prisons , and interrogates them .

Credible reports allege that the CIA uses torture to extract information from them .

( I 've written about one of the victims a little over three years ago ) .

When some of the victims are trying to pursue their cases in federal court , the Bush administration tried to throw out their cases on a theory about government secrets .

Obama , consistent with the rest of his human rights rhetoric , sharply criticized Bush for it .

But now that Bush 's secrecy theory is before an appeals court , Obama is changing his mind .

Without qualifications , he is now sticking to the Bush position that torture victims cannot sue the CIA , because the torture is a state secret .

We all voted for Obama because of these policies but where do we turn to really gain a government of the people for ALL the people .

Democrat , republican , all I see are crooked politicians who are only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us .

Well it was n't just campaign promises , he repeated it in his inauguration , when he already had the presidency in hand .

" We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals ."

Apparently he was missing some qualifiers , so I 'll fix it for him :

" We sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals when it is politically convenient ."

Does n't look good , but I do n't know anything beyond what 's here .

I 'm still in politics detox mode and still just not following this stuff .

Even half @-@ ways intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that 's been driven into their heads .

Today is the first I heard about the story on NPR .

I admit I do n't know the facts but on it 's face I disagree with the decision .

It certainly had n't made it into my paper unless I skimmed over it .

Gushing like teenagers about their first crush ? I do n't gush Thomas .

With nothing to go on except the link to the NYT article , it looks more like there is n't going to be legal action against CIA and the unnamed Boeing subsidiary for activities they were assured were legal at the time .

I never felt obliged to report every screwup made by the previous administration .

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , partisans of Ronald Reagan claimed he had " won " the cold war .

Although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true , the claim was that the Soviet Union became overextended attempting to keep up with Ray @-@ gun 's defense spending .

Pappy Bush , who was the president at the time , claimed that he had won the cold war since the collapse of the Soviet Union happened on his watch .

Globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their " victory , " and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world .

Always impatient of any restaint , capitalists used this so @-@ called victory as justification for the opposition to , or calls for the roll @-@ back of any regulatory restraint .

Now , with the various " Occupy " movements , it is ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies , as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest .

What are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities ?

@Setanta , Unfettered capitalism has yielded an Oligarchy .

Health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not EVER do whats right for humanity .

@Setanta , I do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .

Capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules , plays by the rules and enforces the rules .

If everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules , understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules , that is where trouble really begins .

Removing rules does n't help business be more competitive , it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there .

That is extremely rude , though I can see the humor in it .

But these kids are listing Geisha costumes , sombreros + donkeys , and a few other costumes that they deem ' racially insensitive '

It is not showing someone doing something derogatory , it is using the clothes of a society for a costume .

Sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended .

There will ALWAYS be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it .

Dressing in a costume or NOT dressing in one will not change that .

And why is it that only those races @/@ cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive ?

Is it not JUST as rude to wear torn over alls , stained shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ?

And if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads , they will always find justification no matter what .

Why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination ?

These students are bleeding idealism and have n't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsessions and that these costumes are n't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be .

I am as uptight about the plight of white people in the US as anyone is .

In fact no one in this story wants to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters .

They say "... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome ".

They are n't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything .

They are making posters expressing their opinion .

Of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech .

But me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech .

Whether your costume involves black face and a noose , or whether it is a grilled sandwich where I think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant .

Free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the " banning " that is being alleged .

You all have turned this story on it 's end .

SO dear Massachusetters , does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting Republican Senator , Scott Brown ?

i 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight i ever saw was a girl fight , lots of kicking , scratching , and some amazing punches ( the loser had to stay home from school for almost a week until swelling went down around her eyes )

I 'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate Republicans we have right where they are .

He may vote along party lines for most things but he 's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal @-@ leaning constituency .

Care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?

Coakley was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - I 'll hunt around for a great article I read a year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made .

As for Brown , he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion .

I have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all , and several which are really just embarrassing .

I have n't really been active in ( or even really cared about ) politics until recently and I 'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this .

Well , just telling you who I 'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right ?

Obama because I think he has done a good job in most areas ; some areas he let me down , plus there is no way I would vote for a republican today .

I think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important .

They are willing to throw America under the bus in order to make Obama look bad .

I 'm voting for Obama because I think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances , and can do much more with another term , and because I really worry about what any of the possible Republican nominees would do as president if one of them won .

I also would n't vote for just about any republican ( especially Rick Perry ) but I have heard some good things about Ron Paul , he 's about the only republican that I 'm actually interested in learning more about .

My own opinion of Ron Paul is that I 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debates .

I like how he 's anti @-@ war and anti @-@ bullshit in general .

Andrew Sullivan has a lot of posts on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learning more .

I read a fascinating piece in the WSJ today .

He apparently appears to be unable to pull Congress together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he got elected to a second term .

He believes that Hillary has the best chance of bringing the country together .

I do n't know how she feels about running , but , IMO , I think that it is a great idea .

She certainly has the smarts , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizens .

The voters who will decide this election , IMO are the moderates and the independents . THEY certainly will not vote for any of the anti @-@ gay , pro @-@ life bible bangers .

Hillary 's time has come , and gone...

She would make her self no friend of the Democratic party by dividing them and losing the black vote...

No one is going to vote for her that did not vote for Mr. Obama , and a whole lot less Obama voters will vote for her...

She has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party...

Best case scenario : Obama gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the Democrats gain a greater foothold of the US Senate and increase their collective mass in the US Congress .

Then that means the Republicans would likely further gain in Congress and even the Senate perhaps .

Then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions .

I suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers .

Actually , I think you are wrong on the moderate @/@ independent voter turnout , too , but I could be wrong .

Like Phoenix , I 'm not greatly impressed by the Republican field .

I guess that in summary , I 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five years .

@jcboy , I hope that the US Congress addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law .

When I studied the Domestic Relations Law of NY , I thought it was a damned INDIGNITY for a government to give permission to citizens to marry .

The citizens created the damned government , their child . David

That is a congested airway , and when you fly under 1000 feet you have no aid from air traffic controllers .

My husband , our kids , and myself were spending a day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids , our long @-@ time friends .

At some point we came across a huge fallen tree , and our friend L. climbed on it and started walking up .

Our 11 year @-@ old son followed him , but L. suddenly realized they won't be able to get down that easily .

He turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too .

Our son stopped but did n't get out of his way at once .

He was having fun , and we had to tell him 2 more times , and then he obeyed .

After that L. got back down , and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might , yelling at him .

Fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened .

We are in deep shock , we never hit our children .

Personally , if someone is my friend , I am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level .

Why can n't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you do n't want them hitting your kids ever again .

I suppose you could add probation ( but that is just a replacement for jail time ) .

If I was angry enough to start down this path I would n't worry about where it ended up .

I would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again .

I do n't know the law where you are , here , it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man , making it clear that ( if your description is accurate ) he had committed an offence , but you could decide against filing charges .

Again , depending on where you live , you could likely notyify child protection authorities .

here , being extra @-@ familial , and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police .

If you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie does .

For instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement .

It might be that police act even if you do n't want them to .

I 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way...though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be had in your area .

However , my concern would be how he treats his own kids .

If you have evidence that he assaults his own kids , I 'd be considering a chold protection notification .

I 'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour .

It did n't warrant such a reaction , but he was thoughtless .

If it was really unusual behaviour from your friend , I am a bit worried about him , too , frankly .

I am a 25 year old woman , and I have been in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man .

He has 2 kids one , from his marriage and one from a previous relationship .

He has been planning to get a divorce since the first day we met ,

He is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye .

He was having sex chats with a lady he met on facebook from Sweden ,

when I found out it affected me really badly .

I felt and still feel betrayed and I can n't trust him .

Do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do ?

A married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now .

A man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex chats online with others .

Personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get .

I have little or no pity for you .

But , you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him .

Then why do n't you think about looking for someone who is not attached .

Your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion .

I am 24 and a mother of a 2 and a half year old .

Me and my son 's father have been broken up since August .

I want to start dating other people and my son 's father says if I do he will have nothing to do with his son .

He is very possesive and controlling but he has no right to be as we are not together .

He has too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work when I have told him several times I dont love him and he does not love me .

I want him to be there for his son without needing me too .

But he has no one his family and him dont get along and have their own issues .

I do n't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he is around the more miserable I will be .

I dont want him to not be there for his son as he is a good father or he at least tries .

I do believe every child needs both parents weather they are together or not .

But he thinks if he cant have me no one can .

What do I do to move on with my life .

Your ex is threatening you using your son... bad , bad , bad .

You can n't give in to that or it will just escalate .

You have a right to live your own life and be happy , so do n't cave to his threats .

If he really loves his son , he 'll see him regardless , but this is just a typical control method that people like him use .

Others say things like , " I 'm going to kill myself if you leave me "... get it ?

Do what you want .

If the price is , he voluntarily walks out of both of your lives , you 're probably better off without him .

I 'd agree - one other thing it is none of his business whether you date or not .

Not because of his threat - but because your personal life is none of his business .

Quit taking his calls , make him leave voice mail .

Make him email or text you .

Get a lawyer and get a divorce .

If you can n't afford one , try legal aid .

Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through the lawyer .

Do they not realise that you do n't get piles of change from the bank ,

someone somewhere is going to have to take the notes ?

I do like to get as near as possible as i woudn't like to be couting coppers all day

take a £20 note on the bus , they just tell you to get on cos theyre lazy as hell

Hello I started university in September , did n't immediately gel with it obviously like most people .

However , I knew it would take me some time to adjust , because I have always been very introverted , and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it .

The first night I was here , all my housemates and I went out and it was the hardest thing I have ever ever had to do .

To go into the SU bar on my own , sober .

- I am not enjoying university having been here 5 months or so ; I 'm disillusioned by the course , not enjoying the projects set , and I do n't like the course delivery as much .

The University made out it was much better than it seems .

- I had a bad start to the first term ; student finance was delayed , adding to my stress levels , I was so worried I was unable to progress with work , conclusively it all piled up .

- I was assigned a counselor through the university ; had seen her for about 5 @-@ 6 weeks ( block sessions ) , if I 'm honest it did n't really work ; because I was never open with her .

- Now the work @-@ load is up to my neck , I have major deadlines to hit , I am depressed , the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time .

In no longer have a counselor because you can only have them for so many sessions at a time , and I doubt it will help much this time , if it has n't already .

- I lack motivation , do n't feel comfortable with any of my lecturers , feel like I want to give in , but can n't bring myself to it , because I will end up in a dead end job , and I aspired to ' be someone '.

- I would rather be dead than not be educated , and live a life I want to live ( and dropping out of uni would make matters worse ) .

- I 'm 21 yrs old ( turn 22 this year ) , do n't have much time left for failing need to do something .

I failed college once over , did another course so I could get to uni do n't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail .

Perhaps go and see your doctor , and see if there 's any way you can get your deadlines extended to try and ease the pressure a bit ?

Send your tutors a similar email to this post ( do n't worry they 've seen it all before - some much more uncomfortable admissions too - I know as I used to work in a Uni Dept admin ) and they will consider mitigating circumstances .

Break your work into manageable chunks .

Concentrate on one bit of work at a time ( obvs the most urgent assignment first ) .

Do n't shut yourself off from your housemates , and well done for trying new things from the very beginning now keep at it !

I 'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too .

If you 've always been an anxious person you might benefit from speaking to someone ( my friend got therapy on the NHS for anxiety , so its really normal ) .

And try and get deadlines extended , if you 're honest I 'm sure your uni will allow it .

My mum is getting divorced - she had a horrible time with my step @-@ father and her new found freedom has sent her round the bend .

She 's epileptic and a manic depressive with a huge anger problem .

I can n't cope with her outbursts and nasty hateful remarks when I 'm at home .

I 'm 18 , a full @-@ time sixth former at a high pressure private school ( on a 95 % bursary ) and I 'm at breaking point .

I can n't do work at home , because she shouts at me .

So then my teachers get angry at me .

One minute she 's lovely , and it 's like having my mummy back , then the next , she turns into the most spiteful human alive .

I 'm not going to pass my A2 exams , I 've already accepted defeat , that this year of my life is going to make me a failure .

Maybe I can come back from this , who knows . I 've got the most amazing university offers , but I can n't even accept them - I 'll never make the grades .

I wish I could wipe her out of my life - things would be so much better without her .

But then , I think I 'm just being selfish .

ut I feel as if I have no control over this downhill spiral .

And I do n't know what to do .

Thanks for reading .

Does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis ?

You do n't know for sure that you won't get good grades so accept places if you can .

I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long 8 years before I came to uni and honestly , the only reason why I 'm here is because it was the only way out .

Work hard if you really want out .

Really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can n't give it to you consistently .

You could call Childline or something similar ?

You could go to the library on saturdays and do a good 8 hours of studying there .

Is there a friend 's house you could go to @- form a study group ?

So you want her sectioned cos she is a bit of a pain in the arse and you 've blamed all your problems on her ?

Oh grow up tsr and stop negging its was a joke ! !!

I think over the last year or 2 i 've become a much weaker person and in a way have dulled down my personality inorder to try and make some friends at uni .

But being overly @-@ nice to people has lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me...

they show absolutely no respect .

e.g. i 'll say hello to someone from uni and they 'll ignore me , but 30 minutes later they 'll decide they want my help with some work... and i 'll give it to them .

It 's causing alot of anger and distress in my life and is really starting to effect my concentration in uni .

has anyone got any experience in handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again ?

Do it gradually if it 's not something you 're particularly comfortable with .

You could start with ' No , sorry but I 'm busy '

Of course , do n't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction .

If , in your mind , you 're thinking no - say it .

When they start to realise that you 're not going to bend over backwards for them , they 'll start respecting you more .

well this is such a bad attitude really , of course you can be respected if you 're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you , that 's not being nice it 's being a fool .

I do n't know if anyone will read this , but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone .

This September I left home , and started at University . I was incredibly anxious about doing this , but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here ! Now I 'm here , and have been for over two weeks , I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward .

I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to Secondary School , although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings . I have had two periods of counselling in my life , over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year .

I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming , and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self @-@ esteem . I have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions , and doubt myself over anything and everything .

Neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression , and both have suggested I do not suffer from it , but it is a huge worry to me , as depression was the cause of my dad 's death , suicide .

I have tried to solve my problems before , and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful , and have also tried things like self @-@ help books and tapes . But my general feeling , is , ' Is this what my life will be ? My one chance at existance , my one chance of being a young man , I am wasting it ! ' And these feelings are beating away at me .

I simply do n't know what to do , and when I think of things to do , I never follow through with it . Friends often say I 'm lazy , and I can n't disagree a lot of the time . I feel like everything anyone could do to help , people have tried , and time and time again I fail .

Sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess , and I feel a bit like a self @-@ seeking moaner , but I truly do feel desperate .

Its not uncommon for people 's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles , i.e. being a university student .

I am not a health professional and I can only speak from personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression .

Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni @- you 're definitely not alone there . But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . It does n't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support @- labels are n't as important as your experiences . Meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . But yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere @- but do n't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse @- be kind to yourself and get some help .

I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by using friends . Whilst it probably is n't a ' solution ' as such , being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed . Either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to PM

If i were you id focus on an idol . Someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc

Focus on what you want to achieve in life , you havent stated what your studying , or indeed why....is it because you wanted the experience ? Because your mum wanted yo to go ? Because u need a degree for the career you want to do ?

Either way , sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say " hey i didnt fail , it was hard work and i passed "

I 'm pretty much non @-@ autistic ( not diagnosed with dyspraxia but I think the doctor misdiagnosed ) , but I walk on my toes nearly all of the time .

What made them decide toe @-@ walking is a sign of autism since it seems so random and is n't always indicative ?

Well I might have signs of something on the autism spectrum but who does n't have one or two ?

Symptoms do n't always apply but if they happen in a lot of cases ( which it clearly must do in this instance ) it 's worth noting , since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnosed .

I used to walk on my toes , but that was because I was born with strange toes that curled under and had to be straightened with surgery two years ago .

My brother 's autistic but I have n't noticed this with him either , but the spectrum is so broad and I myself probably have mild asperger 's because I have problems with communication and do n't pick up on social reactions @/@ body language .

But then I do n't have a proper diagnosis and even having some symptoms might not mean you have a certain condition .

I walk on my toes not as much since years of being told not to .

So maybe you are dyspraxic or have short tendons .

People who do dance/ gymnastics/ ballet etc have it drilled into them , to the point where I find it more comfortable now =P

i started when i was seven as i slit each firnger indevidually with sissors , and from that day i never stopped ,

it has got worse as i have a scar on my leg as i slit in my ex boyfriends name with stables , as i wont stop cutting unless i bleed ,

i have sevral slits on my arm ,

they healed , then i cut myself with staples i robbed from school and a razor .

when i cant find anything to cut with i take around 5 paracetmols and other drugs and i take them with larger and vodka .

as im writing this i am really tempted to cut my arm or burn myslef ,

i am addicted , when ever one heals i cut again

i am 12 and i am already sick of my life .

the source of this is that ; when i was 7 my dad left , and he doesnt want to know me anymore ,

he just cares about his new little girl and wife , his new life , where im not wanted .

my best mate died when i was 10

i had a reltionship with a boy who is 16 and i am forbidden to speak to him because of what happend and the age diffrience

also my mum suffers from bi polar and i have depression

i dont what to stop ,

i dont care what i do to myself , i want to do it again and again to tourture myslef , i hate me .

however , my best mate , i love him , loads , he means the world to me and if i do anything then he will ,

i dont tell him but he finds out ,

i dont want to hurt him , i dont want him to hurt himself

thanks you for reading

Are you on any drugs or getting any therapy ?

It might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what 's going on .

Perhaps there 's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell .

If you tell people they can help you ,

Trust me , it 's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse .

I 'm 17 I started self harming last year , mainly cutting my arms , but I have stopped since the last few months ,

its hard but you can do it .

I feel so much happier , but seeing the scars is both a painful reminder of how I felt at that time , how strong my feelings were that I would want to do such a thing to myself !

self harming is addictive , but you can overcome it ,

I often have to check twice at one go , then after 30 seconds for some reason I cant resist checking again !

If I do n't check , I get very very anxious , which does sort of go away after 15 @-@ 30 mins , but often the anxiety is so much that I can n't wait that long .

I feel if I lost my wallet or phone , then I 'm doomed or so I feel .

I just wish I could go out without worrying every 2 mins whether I 've left or lost something .

I really dont know what to do , and am afraid of going to the GP .

They 've probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just dont know what to do

People would think I 'm crazy , but it 's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this .

I used to do this on my way to college @-@ I had a list of items I knew I had on me and used to check compulsively on the bus .

I now have more severe anxiety and think this was just a warning sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it 's relatively fresh @-@ definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things ( easier said than done I know ) .

To get rid of it , one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so do n't check to see whether you have lost something , just leave it (:

I am very obsessional to the point where I get up 20 times a night to check the locks in my house are all locked a particular way .

Sometimes although I know they 're locked I 'm convinced they 're not .

You definitely are n't crazy though do n't worry and your GP will be understanding of the issue I 'm sure .

I go to therapy ( for other reasons also ) and they have encouraged me to pick a number of times to check , obviously that is less than 20 , and to stick to it and cut down that way .

I think the idea is to teach me , I 'm still ' okay ' if I check 5 times or 20 times .

So far I have been a lot better , I think there is definitely hope of improvement for anyone that wants it .

Usually I 'm pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not to worry too much .

However , over the last month or two I 've found myself becoming really anxious about things , and I 'm not talking about a mere out of the blue feeling of nervousness .

I have begun to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things which beforehand would n't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bells to ring in my head .

I 'm not sure if it 's the change in lifestyle ( going from care @-@ free student to unemployed graduate ) that is causing this or if it 's a sign of other issues , but it 's beginning to bug me as it 's affecting my confidence and happiness .

I 've spoken to a few people about it including my parents but they all think the same : that I 'm going through a random phase and that I should hold off taking action until it is clear that it is a serious problem

Speak to a doctor about it and see if anti @-@ anxiety pills could take the edge off of things ?

Or should I take the advice given by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem ?

Well I woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky ( circle of demise there )

what I would try to do is focus on something that is garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything .

Or if u cant do that @-@ when you start to feel panicky , get one of your friends to make you laugh ( it works for me and i suffer from random panic attacks lol

Perhaps not in a moany way but I found that mentioning the thing that I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation in a calm way ( like I should have been reacting ) made me feel better about it because I knew it was n't a big deal and I did n't need to be anxious about it .

I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she 's so worried about what can go wrong .

The doctors gave her medication and it 's made her much better .

I 'm very close to breaking point ,

I 've kept it to myself forever , then told a friend a few months ago cause I just could n't cope anymore .

Then a week 1 @/@ 2 ago , I declared my love for the girl in a text when I was drunk .

She eventually replied a couple of days later being unbelievably kind about it , which has really just made me fall even deeper ( if this is possible ) .

I told her she would n't hear from me for a while , you know , so I can attempt to move on .

So now I 'm at the start of the move on phase , but I 'm just stuck .

I cut off most of my hair and I 've started exercising and changing my diet to try to alter the chemicals in my body to make me feel better that way , but does n't seem to be working , i 'm still miserable .

A song about love will come on my itunes ( pretty much every song in the world ) or a song that reminds me of her , and i 'll just break down .

I feel like just dropping out of uni and getting on a flight to australia and never coming back .

During a really low point last week I cut myself ( which i had n't done in years ) just because i had so much pent @-@ up emotion , i had to let it out somehow .

I really do n't know what to do or how to help myself be happy again .

People say time is a healer but I do n't know if I 'll be able to hold out that long !

Find activities to occupy your time .

There has to be something you really enjoy doing ?

Set some goals for yourself . i.e.:

- Go to the gym 5 times a week for an hour a day .

- Meet one new person a day and engage in a meaningful conversation .

Find an activity you like , set some goals , stick to them .

The key is to occupy yourself and meet new people .

Maybe make a new playlist on itunes for starters , with happy music . ' Don't stop ' by Fleetwood mac , etc.

Try , like /\ /\ suggested , getting a hobby , going to the gym etc.

Try counting all the things that you do have in life ,

sure you might not have her , but I 'm sure you have a number of other things .

It might seem impossible at the moment , but pick yourself up and live life with as much energy as you can .

Talking to people on here is always a place to start , have made some wonderful friends on here

When I was in your exact same position I turned to religion and Islam has worked very well boosting up my self @-@ content .

I really like this girl and she 's in a few of my classes at university .

Everytime i look at her i find her looking banck at me .

Regardless I do n't know her that well but i fancy her a lot .

I was going to ask her out but for the past few weeks i 've been waiting for the right time ( which never comes , partly coz i 'm scared ) .

But being valentines day , should i ask her out and give her a card , or would that be cheesy .

I see her tomorrow and i could approach her .

I sometimes worry what her mates will think of me , i do n't know i 'm nervous but it has to be done so i can move on i guess

Forget about the friends ; if she 's a nice girl , go for it !

Be casual , as you run the risk of coming on too strong if you do anything seriously Valentine 's @-@ y .

Well , in my estimation , while it is " romantic " to ask on Valentine 's day , it 's also high @-@ pressure .

Either way , coffee date ( or something similar.)

Ask as soon as you can manage to get it off your chest .

Asked my girlfriend what fantasies she wants to indulge in , turns out she wants to have a threesome with a lesbian @/@ bi friend of hers that 's wanted to **** her for ages .

And yes the third party is fit and has let my gf touch her before .

My girlfriend is straight but she gets a kick out of pleasuring people , if that makes sense .

I 'm really kind of split on the issue tbh , I do n't have much experience with this sort of thing , if I was in a no @-@ strings relationship they would be no stopping me , but I can n't help feeling that going through with it would spoil things between us .

But then again we 're young and it is something I 'd like to kick off the bucket list , as it were .

What should I look out for/ be careful of , really do n't want to ruin things with my girlfriend , but the idea of a threesome is thrilling , not gunna lie .

Not really , threesomes in relationships can really cause issues ,

Im sexually open minded but theres no way id share my gf with a boy or girl .

If im single yeah sure , attached no way .

If my gf suggested it id tell her no , straight out .

Sorry but i dont share .

If you are n't planning on being with this girl forever then go for it .

If her friend has wanted to ' f**k her for ages ' I doubt it will end well

Apparentley threesomes can really ruin relationships , as they can make people insecure and unconfident .

If you have any insecurities at all , then I would recommend you not do it .

I 've been with my girlfriend for well over a year now , and I 'm quite selfless towards her .

I do everything I can to make her life easier and better , and we both love each other .

It means that I spend generously if needed and put a lot of time and effort into the relationship .

As in , thinking about where we 'd be a couple years from now and how serious she was about staying with me .

Turns out , that she did n't really like me that much when we started dating and she was just seeing how things went ( although now she says she is very happy , but surprised , that she has stayed with me this long ) .

I asked her what she thought about where we 'd be and she said she does n't want to think about that , and that I should be happy about the experiences we 've had ( which I am ) .

My issue is that , should I continue putting so much effort into her if it just seems like I 'm " what 's good right now " for her , although it seems as if she does n't want to make any plans or even hope to stay together for a long time .

It just seems unfair that I 'm putting in a lot more effort into this relationship and that if we did break up , she 'd have gained a lot more than I did as a result .

In your situation I would say enjoy the moment you 're in now .

Currently I 'm on the fence in regards to getting more serious with a guy who is technically still married , has two children and has openly told me does not want to get married again or have any more kids .

If you ever find yourself in a situation like this thinking about the future early on is a must in my opinion because there is a lot more at stake .

My boyfriend has one of those jobs where he 's on call a lot .

He said we 'll not make reservations but we will make plans etc but not to bank on it .

I 'm not angry at him @- I 'm in uni and I know how it is for things to change suddenly .

But I need to find a way to cope with this .

If I get all dressed up and sit waiting , he often texts me saying he has to cancel .

If I do n't get ready , he comes home and I 'm in my pjyamas , not showered or ready in anyway .

It ruins the night because I have to run around and get ready and I do n't get to do any of the things I wanted to .

Bless you I know where you 're coming from .

My boyfriend is a bobby so he often has to stay late because of a job , he 's been hours and hours before getting back .

It makes it harder because we 're in an LDR so we have little time together anyway and with me at uni and him with only two days off a week now in comparision to the three @/@ four it 's hard .

I do n't think you can not get disappointed .

I realise that and sounds like you do too but it does n't make it any easier .

It 's just something we have to deal with .

Value the moments you do get to spend together , try not to plan things in advance if things are likely to cancel but be prepared for a bit of spontaneity , maybe have an outfit already in your head you could wear at last minute ?

It 's frustrating , you 're not alone in feeling the way you do .

I 'm studying abroad for a year and my boyfriend is going to come visit me a few times times .

Should I pay for some/half/any of his plane ticket ?

I feel bad when I have all this spare loan money and he 's having to save up for weeks to come see me , which is something we both want .

I did n't do abroad , but when my ex and I were apart he 'd pay for his tickets and I 'd pay for everything whilst he was staying at mine -@ food , transport etc ( when he let me anyway ) .

I guess as he 's having to save up that living costs wont cover it .

I 'd suggest either half , or if it makes him feel less bad about it , alternate - so he pays for the first trip , you pay for the second etc.

When I lived abroad my boyfriend at the time would pay for his flights

i'v had the occasions of seeing guys , but it never ends good or lasts long .

Since november last year i havn't been in a proper relationship and life 's getting a bit too quiet for my liking .

Some that i meet , i 'll be physically attracted to them..but they have no personality to them..you could say their like male barbie dolls .

However , some i will meet who have such a lovely personality , but i wont be attracted to them physically .

Im starting to feel like it 's me who is the problem .

I can n't seem to find anyone who is n't just interested in sex...

Use your gold digger ability and find a rich man .

It does get a bit demoralising sometimes when everyone around you is in a relationship , especially now which is probably the worst time of year to be single .

I would n't blame yourself though , you probably just have n't had an opportunity come along .

I 've met plenty of nice girls at uni but it takes a lot for me to actually develop feelings for someone , and i can n't say i 've met anyone who i genuinely have feelings for .

I 'd rather wait until i do then find a girlfriend for the sake of it - try and think of things that way ?

Just have to keep putting yourself out there i guess , if you 're constantly meeting new people or getting better acquainted with people you already know , an opportunity will come up eventually .

Theres a fair chance you 've caught someones eye already and they 're keeping quiet about it

So me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half months ago .

Do n't know how it all happened but she said she 'd like to see me during the Christmas holidays .

Now I had this weird thing going on with this breakup.. for the first 2 weeks I felt totally heartbroken , then I was getting on good for a while , then went back to being really sad , etc.

Before I came back I felt like I was over it ; then I came back , and suddenly , yet again feel unhappy .

Either way , from what I 've heard , she is n't really the same kind of person she was when we were together ( in a good way for me ; apparently like the kind of girl I 'm not interested in ) , so meeting with her might totally kill whatever residual feelings there are and I can get on with my life .

Or it won't work and I 'll spiral back into sadness .

Or we may get back together , since she told me she might feel differently in the future . ( ie , want me back , after a break that 's less ' stressful '; not that we ever had a stressful time.. ) .

I do n't think this is ideal , but I 'm an idiot . I know I still feel kind of possessive over her..

I hate the thought of her with another guy .

So should I meet with her ? Or not ? Or delete her out of my life entirely ? or what..

if you want her back , do it .

if you want to be over her , do n't go .

I would say 90 % chance that will end up feeling even more sad than you are if you go see her , coz feeling do n't just die in 2 months ( unless there was nothing at the start ) .

I met up with my ex after 2 years of no contact at all and still feelings came back .

so yeah , do n't fool yourself . whatever that girl is doing now is probably just a pretend , trying to move on , be a changed person , ect ect .

Do n't expect to feel nothing when you see her .

ok its very important to know this quote : " Once a girl leaves her boyfriend , the only reason she might wanna be back is to hurt her bf "

Dude , do n't meet up with her even if you love her to death because once you have broken up , there is no way back and all this meeting will do to you is to make you feel upset afterwards .

I was in the similar situation couple of momth ago and i just kept this girl away from me and you ought to do the same since once something is over , then it is OVER

I really need advice .

Me and my boyfriend started dating when we were 16 , and we 're now at uni still going out .

He 's always been the sweetest guy , I mean really nice and funny but these past few months things have changed .

He 's had problems at home lately , and things have been really tough for him .

But recently I 've learnt not to bring it up in conversation or he 'll get really angry about it .

I do n't want to go into details but lately he 's been getting agry at the slightest things , and if I can n't calm him down he 'll get violent especially after a drink .

He 'll always laugh it off afterwards as if he didnt mean it , and I know he doesnt because he is a good guy .

I 've tried talking to him about it several times , telling him I 'll leave him if he does it again but it hasnt stopped , and he has such a hold on me I dont think I could never leave him .

Im so emotionally drained and dont want any friends to know because they 'll just think bad of him , when really he is good deep down .

Sorry for the rambling , I just needed to get that out .

I 'm posting anonymously because what I am going to say is very personal .

Just over two years ago my girlfriends step @-@ father was hurting her mum .

My girlfriend went to help her mum and in turn was hit over the head by a glass bottle . As you might expect the police were called and the prick was arrested .

He appeared in court the next day and plead not @-@ guilty to assaulting her mum and assaulting her to her injury ( serious assault in scotland ) .

Now this is where my story gets really sick .

I type this and I am full of rage .

My girlfriends mum writes to the court and asks for her husbands bail conditions to be dropped as well as for the charges to be dropped .

She tells the court NOT to write to her at her own address or phone her home - this stopped my girlfriend from finding out what her mum was up to .

In Scotland , domestic abuse charges are not dropped if a victim requests for them to be dropped .

Though the bail conditions were dropped by the High Court in Edinburgh - this allowed the cowardly little prick to contact my girlfriend , her mum and enter the family home .

We found this out on December 23 rd 2009 at about 7.30pm when her mum phoned her to say her husband was back in the house and wanted to talk about what happened .

We phoned the police because as far as we were aware bail conditions were still in place .

Her mum kicked her out on Christmas Eve 2009 to allow the prick to stay .

Seeing my girlfriend in tears at 16 years old was absolutely heart @-@ breaking for me .

I did not know how to help but all I did was worry and worry .

My behaviour started to change , I had recently started a career in the Merchant Navy but due to stress I started to develop problems .

I was eventually referred to a psychologist by my GP to deal with anxiety .

When the case went to trial , her mother lied and said my girlfriend attacked him .

If my mum had not calmed me down then I would be in prison just now .

Two years on and my girlfriend has forgiven her mum .

They live in a flat and the mum disappears at the weekend - 10 points if you can guess who she goes to see .

I do not visit the flat when her mum is in .

I have had arguments with her mum where I have said some absolutely vile things which I am not in the least bit proud about .

I have asked my girlfriend to stay with her dad as I still worry .

Basically me not liking her mum affects our relationship a little bit - if we were ever to take the next step and eventually get married then I do not know how we would do it , though my girlfriend assures me that we would manage somehow .

What I am trying to say is that domestic abuse does not just affect you - it will affect everyone you care about .

Please take what I have said to heart and leave this guy .

He has n't picked up literally 7 @/@ 8 of my calls .

I did get to speak to him the last time I rung him ( after him blanking 7 @/@ 8 calls ) and I asked him what 's up but he did n't tell me ( this was over a month ago ) .

He did this before once two years ago as well over nothing but I can n't really remember how it proceeded...i guess he just gradually starting calling again .

I 'm starting to lose trust in him now .

I do n't know if I 'm overreacting , but I just feel really hurt about the way he 's neglecting me again and I 'm literally crying as I write this .

I let him get away with it last time but I 've had enough .

I do n't know what I aim to achieve writing this on a student forum , but any ideas on what should I do ? is it worth ending the relationship ?

I do n't wanna ring him any more because I feel insulted that he just casually blanks my calls .

And asking him does n't help either since he 's not gunna tell me .

1 ) He 's got something to hide .

If you 're saying he acted this way before about 2 years ago and then perfectly fine later on , there 's clearly something going on in his mind .

I do n't know if that 's cheating or if there 's something else , but there 's clearly something he 's not sharing with you

3 ) He 's autonomous and needs a LOT of space .

Even if it 's a long distant relationship , sometimes receiving phonecalls ( depending on how often you 'd call him ) could actually affect his perception on how he feels about the relationship .

I think if you were to give him a ' taste of his own medicine ' then effectively you might receive the response you 're expecting but I think what 's missing here most is communication .

When you see him next time , do n't criticise or start questioning him .

Just express your worries to him and maybe you 'll get something out of him .

Ok so I am female and like males , always have , obsessed with a few male celebs and see myself wth guys .

However occassionally I seem to have feelings for older females but I 'm not sure if they are like sexual feelings and it 's quite confusing .

For the first time there is a female who I like whos quite a bit older and I definitely have feelings .

I deliberately try to talk to her and spend time with her even though shes clearly quite a bit older .

If you 're physically attracted to men and you 're not sexually aroused by her , I 'd say you have your answer there It might be that you get nervous and your heart beats faster because you are anxious to please her , or her opinion of you matters to you ?

If you scour the forums and do a search , you 'll see that you 're not the only one who has ever felt like this about a teacher of the same gender .

I used to - in fact , still ! - attach to female teachers and tutors a lot .

My counsellor had great fun dissecting it and telling me how I 'm sexually attracted to mother figures , but he was just an arse

In first year we were always together in the same group of friends..

Now in second year , he 's decided he does n't want to see me anymore .

He wants to be ' friends '.

I think he 's got someone else.. and that 's why he 's finished it but I do n't really care that he 's finished it .

What I do care about is that I 've been completely cut out .

He lives in the same place as me and has n't spoken to me once since .

I 've been cut out of nights out , get togethers.. etc all because I 'm not seeing him anymore .

This really upsets me , I want to be friends with him and I 'm willing to be but he seems to have cut me out so now I 'm not seeing other people either

What can I do/say ?

Other people have cut me out because I 'm not with him anymore either !

In future you make your own friends , not someone elses .

My ex cut me out as soon as he got a new gf even though he promised to be friends , and that was 2 months ago

its bloody hurtful and hard

at first i spent the first 5 weeks cryingmy eyes out not sleeping , then it ended up that i felt i had done something wrong and therefore he dumped me

he let me blame myself and for weeks i kept thinking what if i had said this or done that , and then i found out him and his new gf were togther behind my back and i was nothing to do with it , .

So i think if you have like one other friend go out with them , maybe get a job or hobby and meet new people show him you dont care these boys love to think we are sitting at home waiting for their text which we might be but they cant know that

I have never done something like this before , but i have nobody to ask/ talk to for advice as i cant tell anybody i know

my ex boyfriend had been with me for about 7 months when he went to uni he cheated on me and dumped me .

He is now in a official relationship with the girl he cheated on me with , becuase of this we have no spoken since he dumped me 2 months ago

However when we did break up i was a bit of a idiot and begged him not to leave me becuase i was in love with him ,

However ive been feeling ill for a few weeks and went i went to the doctor she said im potentially pregnant .

yes i need to do a test but i dont know when as i cant let anybody find out ,

also i feel i cant tell nmy ex as he thinks everything i do is for his attention to gain him back ,

if i tell him i might be pregnant he willl assume im lying to break up him and his new gf which im not but i dont know what to do

im scared and i dont know how i can tell hiim without him accusing me of being a liar .

What kind of a doctor would say that without giving you a test ?

do a test and get it all over and done with

How about you do a test first and then think of the how to approach it ?

...take it from one who knows , no Doctor is going to tell you that you might be pregnant , and then send you home to deal with it .

Get on and do it and then sort yourself out .

Like get up and go now .

They 'll give you another test just to make sure ( however pregnancy tests are rarely wrong when they read positive ) .

They will discuss your options with you and probably direct you towards some people who can give you counselling if you ask .

Your options are obviously : termination , continue with pregnancy and have the child adopted , continue with pregnancy and keep the child .

First off , it 's best that I explain that I 've barely any experience with girls .

I 'm in my second year of uni and I , um , ' opened my account ' in the sexual world the other night with a girl at my student union .

We 've met a few times before and have quite a few mutual friends , so she was n't a complete stranger .

Went back to hers for the night ( she chose that location because she had lectures the following morning ) and thought I handled the actual sex relatively well...

I can be pretty insecure at times ( it 's a wonder I actually made it back to hers , because I was worried I was imposing too much ) , and when I woke up I panicked and said I had to go and get some work done ( which I genuinely did , although thinking back on it , it was a weak reason to leave ) .

She decided not to go in for her lecture ( which I eventually realised was probably a hint for me to stay for a bit ) and we had a pretty friendly chat whilst I collected my phone , keys etc. together .

She even asked if I wanted her to come back to mine , but I refused and said something stupid like ' nah it 's okay , have a lie in ', which I 've been kicking myself for .

I just got myself into a panic and had a mental block .

So I left , and sent her a light @-@ hearted text a couple of hours later apologising for leaving so hastily and hoping that she had a good night... and did n't get a response .

From here , I do n't know where to go .

To her , I probably came off as someone who does this all the time , and she was just one girl on a list of dozens I 've had one night stands with .

I just felt like I was a bit clinical and almost rude , especially with her asking if I wanted her to come back with me .

All I want to do now is somehow show her that I 'm not an absolute prick , without seeming too desperate or clingy .

I realise the error of my ways , and have beaten myself up over it massively ever since I left hers...

I do n't think it 's a completely irretrievable situation , because she 's genuinely a lovely girl , and I reckon I can convince her I 'm not the womanising idiot she ( probably ) thinks I am... but my lack of experience with girls leaves me with no idea what to do .

i 'd suggest giving her another text asking perhaps to meet up - cinema , dvd , or grab a coffee @/@ lunch before lectures or something .

Just text her and invite her to go out .

To clarify are you just looking to ' have fun ' with the girl , or are you cool with the idea of going a little serious ?

I 'm not really sure , to be honest .

I kinda wanna take it one step at a time .

Asking her out for a cuppa could be a good idea , although I do n't want to do that just as a way of saying sorry .

I 'd rather clear the air first and show her that I know I made a mistake before getting into anything else with her .

I 'm scared as to how he might react and it 's been 4 weeks and I 've still not found the perfect moment to tell him .

Also I 'm afraid what if he does n't want to keep it when I really do .

Although he 's a couple of year older than me ( 19 ) , he can act really immature , aggressive , and violent at time .

My parents have come to terms with it now after having little mini heart attacks , it 's just how can I break it to him ?

Make sure your having a proper convo like one on one and eye contact , then break it to him .

Remember it will be a shock to him but hopefully in the end he will pull though and surport you .

I do n't think there is a way to tell him other than just being straight to the point .

Regardless of his reaction or personal feelings about pregnancy or abortion , he has a right to know .

Talk to him about what you want to do and what he would like to happen .

If you agree , great . If you can n't then talking to your parents might be the next best thing .

Well he asked you to get the morning after pill , did you say you would ?

If you agreed to take the morning after pill but did n't then that 's quite unfair and he will be annoyed .

It 's obvious he did n't want a baby because he was using contraception and even though it failed he did say he wanted you to take the morning after pill , so do n't be surprised if he does a runner .

You just have to be honest with him and hopefully he will take care of his responsibilities .

You said your Mum knows ?

Well break the news with her by your side then , hopefully your boyfriend won't get violent or anything .

Give him time to digest the information .

It will come as a shock , particularly if you thought you 'd played it safe .

I know you said you did n't think you could have an abortion , but it 's important to talk things through with him and decide what 's best to do for both of you and , most importantly , for the baby .

Yeah I 'll tell you guys tomorrow I 'm just afraid as he 's prone to act violent at times .

+ He told me to take the pill and I did n't and he 's gonna be like ' WTF There 's no way I can support a child at 19 and that you should n't be having a kid as you 're not even 18 yet blah blah blah '...

So I 'll just tell him he does n't have to be involved with our child financially and I just want him to be there for it as a fatherly figure ( which I doubt he can commit to ) as my Parents can support us anyways .

This is going to sound harsh and I understand it is your body , but I am going to be brutally honest .

Firstly , you may want to keep it , but think about it in the long run .

You are still a kid yourself , around 16 @/@ 17 I would assume .

He is 19 , I doubt he has any long term plans to stay with you .

By keeping the baby you are pretty much being selfish .

Yeah its your body , but there are 2 people you need to think about :

1. The baby . I can almost guarantee you will not be able to give the baby a good life because of how young you are , and I doubt the father will stay .

2. Your boyfreind . He is 19 , you are dragging him down for life at such a young age by keeping it .

Yourself . You may end up regretting it in the long run .

Do everyone a favor and have an abortion .

You will just end up adding to the long and miserable statistic .

EDIT : Cant believe I was actually negged for this . Truth ****ing hurts .

I 'm confused , i love him or i thought i did so why am i turned off him now ?

He admitted to me that he is bisexual we were talking about ex 's and he told me about one ex who is another guy .

I was shocked and asked him why he did n't tell me before , he said he did n't see a reason to tell me because he liked me a lot .

He should have told me , i 'm turned off at the thought of him with other guys and being sexually attracted to another guy .

Will this feeling go away or shall i break up ?

Do n't feel guilty for feeling like that .

Nothing wrong with being bi , but just as bi 's have a taste for guys and girls , some people do n't have a taste for bi 's , if you know what I mean ?

If you 're really into him stick around , maybe it 's just the shock that 's making you feel this way .

Maybe wait a few days and see how the news settles with you before making a decision ?

Everyone has a past , to judge him on his would be unfair if you love him .

But if it turns you off or you can n't come to terms with it then its probably best to break it off .

Either way , give yourself a few days to think about it first if you 're not sure .

I 've suffered with excess body hair since I was young , and I was bullied because of it through primary @/@ secondary school and now am unable to wear tshirts etc in public because of how paranoid I am about it .

I went to the doctors because of it when I was around 11 , and they did a blood test but it came back normal so I assume I do n't have PCOS .

I have very hairy arms for a girl , not thick hairs like a males but lots of very noticable , dark and long ( I bleach regularly but it only lasts a day or two before the roots are noticable ) .

I have never shaved them because I shave my legs and get terrible ingrown hairs , even though I moisturise @/@ exfoliate etc.

I 've tried waxing but it only lasted 2 days before the hairs began to grow back , so it 's really not worth it .

Anyway I checked out reviews and after shopping around I decided to get the £350 Boots Smooth Skin Plus Intense Pulsed Light permanent hair reduction machine .

The reviews were on the whole very good , it comes with 20,000 flashes ( it takes between 70 @-@ 100 flashes to do my arms each time I think ) and you need applicator gel which is £3 .

It appears to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic , but cheaper and means I will be able to target any missed hairs you might get going to a clinic and it 's obviously private/convenient .

The sales assistant in Boots was very helpful , and assured me I could get a no @-@ quibble refund if I find it does n't work but she assured me it will .

I 'm going to use it on my arms first of all , because this is the area that affects me the most confidence wise , but will gradually move on to other areas .

For permanent hair reduction I will need to use the machine once a week for between 6 @-@ 12 weeks ( although I will probably need 12 weeks ! ) and will start using it tonight .

I 'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because I 'm confident I can return it , I think it was worth the risk .

I know other girls on here have the same issue with excess body hair , so will monitor the hair reduction over the 12 weeks course to let you know how it goes incase anyone else is thinking of buying one

Week 1: Shaved my arms and zapped them today , did it in two separate goes ( took around 30 mins to do each arm ) and my sister did them for me just because certain angles are tricky to get to .

On a pain scale I 'd give it 2 @/@ 10 ( just feels like a hot , tingling sensation for about 1 second then fades ) .

Week 2: Had to shave my arms again last night all over , hair regrowth not as course or fast as expected but still widespread .

Just finished zapping them again but this time did it myself , found it to be much quicker .

I was thinking of buying one of these because I just think it would be the best thing ever to never have to shave my bikini area again !

If this works well I would definitely buy one , I hate shaving and my arms are quite hairy as well ( I do n't shave or bleach them but I am self conscious ) , so I 'd love to be hair free forever .

Thanks for doing this , OP.

I 've been debating whether to get one of these machines too .

I suffer from excess body hair and would love for a machine that could get rid of it !

Is there any way you can use this kind of thing on your face ?

I assume goggles would be necessary but it would be really nice if it were possible .

I have been looking both at this and the Phillips Lumea , which is a little more expensive , but I keep thinking it 's too much of an expense for something that I 'm not 100 % sure will work .

Looking forward to hearing what your results are like for this , as I 'd love to be able to buy something that would mean I would n't have to shave every two days in the summer !

In an ideal world I 'd like to hit a 8 @/@ 10 .

I ask this because I want to start ' mingling '.

I 'd like to look like ' something special ' for once .

Styling your hair and cloth helps a lot .

A bit of make @-@ up , almost every girl wears make @-@ up .

Dye your hair a ridic colour .

Im really pale and sick of using fake tan...coming out patchy and smelling like curry is awful !

I have loads of freckles over my body so it doesnt even look nice natural !

I wanted to start using sunbeds...not to often but just to build a nice natural tan !

But when i go on holiday i burn really easily so i was wondering whether i would burn if i went on the sunbeds or if i built it up it would be gradually get my skin to go tanned ?

Pale freckly skin is lovely , and sunbeds are really dangerous and just not good for you .

Sunbeds are very dangerous , especially with regular use and for people with naturally pale complexions , and you say you have ' freckles ' all over your body .

Or just be pale and beautiful as I am

I am so confused and annoyed !

My mac nc55 studio fix fluid was perfect for my face a couple of months ago but now my face looks dull and...muddy/ashy ?

Also my face and chest had a ridiculous colour difference .

I googled nc45 just now and the girls actually look around my skin tone :/

Is it possible to go from nc55 to nc45?

My problem is where I should match my foundation to .

My face is medium , my neck slightly darker and my chest so pale ( compare to face and arms ) it 's unbelieveable .

I would actually call my chest an nc 44 .

I feel I would look ghostly if I used nc45 but then my chest and face would be the same , help !

Yes I have to different MAC foundations because my skin changes all the time .

I would suggest going to the counter and asking them to match you again .

Someone said that NW30 @/@ 35 is meant to be a good shade for ( brown/black ) people who find themselves changing shades

If you matched it to your chest would n't your neck look weird though ?

I would always say to match to your face as your natural colouring will always suit you best .

I 'm very pale caucasian and my chest is darker than my face , if I were to match to my chest I 'd just look a bit mucky , like I had n't washed in weeks , and I think that if your foundation does n't completely blend into your natural skintone along your jawline you can look like you 're wearing a mask .

I recommend getting colour matched to your jawline and then adjust with bronzers/highlighters .

I got my nose pierced a couple of weeks ago with a stud .

It 's not a bone so it is literally just a stud , similar to earrings .

Because of this is falls out all the time as theres nothing inside to keep it in place .

I want to change to an L @-@ shaped stud , but i 'm worried it won't go in easily because i 've had it pierced with a straight stud .

Go back to the piercer and ask for it to be changed or find a piercer who will , they should be able to swap it without any fuss .

I had mine pierced with a straight stud , it was flipping awkward .

Do n't do what I did though , and change it before the 6 weeks or whatever , as you will probably get an infection which comes up as a nasty wart thing on your nose . D :

The L @-@ shaped studs are different to put in to the straight ones , but if you get the technique right , once you do it correctly , you can do it again .

You put the first bit of the L shape in the hole , making sure you can feel the tip of the end on the inside of your nose .

Then press firmly , twisting slightly upwards and it should slide in .

If you still have troubles , just go see the piercer and they 'll put it in for you

I noticed i was getting these permanent forehead lines and that my face was a bit dry .

I decided to use some moisturizer and its helped .

Do many other guys choose to moisturize ?

The daily wash on my face , the exfoliating scrub twice a week , and the anti @-@ shine moisturiser on a daily basis ( at least ) .

I use cheap generic moisturiser after shaving because my skin gets dry and sometimes tender after shaving .

I only do it after a shave because otherwise the facial hair stops it from melting into the skin properly .

Any moisturiser labelled as ' aftershave balm ' or ' aftershave lotion ' or ' for men ' etc. is just a big rip off .

It is exactly the same stuff as cheap moisturiser but it is marketed towards meathead guys who think that moisturiser is ' liek so gay '.

Nivea aftershave lotion is around £3 @-@ 5 for a tiny 100 ml bottle wheras you can get a big 500 ml bottle of generic stuff for about a pound that has exactly the same effect .

" Oh , it has the word ' man ' in it so it is n't gay anymore "

I had grade 2 acne and it was particularly bad when I ' overwashed ' so I was compelled to wash less and to start moisturising ( Nivea : Dry Skin , after washing or shaving ) in my late teens .

I also use moisturising shower gel or I get BACNE , nice

goes down well with the ladies and I look a LOT younger than my years , though that 's probably more to do with genetics eh

I got the Ciate Nail polish in Kitten Heels Ilamasqua Sheer lipgloss in Explode Nouveau strip lashes Weleda Pomegranate Regenerating Body Oil and Xen @-@ Tan Deep bronze luxe .

I like the idea of the glossy box and was going to sign up a couple of months ago . But I am worried incase I end up with a load of stuff I just wont use .

I want to sign up but I 'm worried I 'll get a load of rubbish too :/

I tried to order a maxi dress online last night from Jane Norman , but when I entered my details , I was told the order had n't gone through .

So I tried inputting my details twice more , to no avail....

So imagine my horror to see that I 'd been charged three times for an item that had n't gone through ? !

I do n't know if they are just closing the stores or both but I think you should see if they have a number you can call .

I just shaved all my hair off and I 'm feeling good .

I think I might buy a lace front wig tomorrow though .

I 've always wanted to do this but never had the courage .

I too would buy a lace front wig if I did it but they 're so damn expensive and time consuming to put on .

I do not know whether to buy a foundation primer - they are very expensive , being almost the same price as the foundation ( for example laura mercier foundation primer ) .

Does anyone have any they would recommend ?

They 're definitely worth it , but I do n't wear a primer every day so I suppose I 'm willing to pay a bit more for them .

I only really wear a primer if I 'm going out .

As a general rule , if your skin is n't totally perfect , or if it 's a bit oily , then a primer is going to make your foundation last a lot longer and look a lot better .

I never used to use it , but in the last few weeks I 've really seen a difference .

Would you get , or do you know anybody who has gotten a Harry Potter tattoo anywhere on their body ?

If you 're confused ( though I can n't see why you would be ) this is what I am talking about

Now , I am as much of a HP fan @-@ geek as the next person , but I would never dream of getting a huge HP montage on my body .

Imo , while I do love HP and have grown up with it etc. etc. , I know when I am 40+ years old I will look back upon the tattoo and wonder what made me decide to get it .

I can understand why people would want to get it done - it 's declaration of their love for HP and stuff , but I personally would n't ever get a Harry Potter tattoo .

Some small quotes @/@ symbols do n't look too bad , but that 's just because I can appreciate the sentiments behind it .

But , while I think they do look pretty cool on other people , I know it is just a phase for me and that 's why I would never have it done .

Has anyone actually had one done or is thinking about getting one done ?

It 's your body , up to you what you put on it .

Sure you will get some funny looks and people will judge you .

Kind of like those Twighlight tattoo 's middle aged women get , I find that more disturbing than young people getting HP tattoo 's - they will probably look back when they are 30 @/@ 40 @/@ 50 and remember their childhood .

Yet these people who get the tattoo 's aged 30+ already.... that 's another story .

Yeah , I mean , it 's one thing to proclaim yourself as a fan of Harry Potter , and another thing entirely to parade around as poster for it

Tbh , most of what people get is just for the sake of getting a HP tattoo , not necessarily because of the meaning or symbolism behind it...

Never.. They do realise that in 50+ years time , they 're still going to have " Expecto Patronum " tattooed on them..?

Imagine trying to explain that to your children @/@ grandchildren " Yes , I did get a tattoo of something from a fiction book..."

I would never get it myself , but I would definitely love to meet a person who would and be their friend lol....devotion to the next level

So after wearing glasses for about 10 years now , I think its finally time to get contacts .

b ) Are the daily ones better than the weeklies ( as they are cheaper )

c ) Say if i do get weeklies/monthlies , can i sleep @/@ go to the shower with them ?

I 'd recommend going to your optician first , you need to know your exact prescription , and whether anything else needs to be looked at , e.g. astigmatism , whether you 'd suit wet ones or drier lenses .

I prefer the daily ones , as there 's no hassle of cleaning and storing them .

You can shower in lenses , but I would n't recommend sleeping in them .

I 've done it a couple of times by accident , and I woke up in pain because they 'd moved around back and sort of folded over under my eyelid .

My eyes and my teeth are the only thing I do n't skimp on , because it 's so ridiculously expensive when things go wrong with them that it 's just better to take very good care of them from the start .

Hi all , Essentially , I 'm looking for a " cover @-@ up " ( for lack of a better word ) I can wear daily .

The thing is I do n't like to wear foundation AT ALL ( my face feels weird ) .

With regards to tinted moisturiser , I have Benefit 's tinted moisturiser - it 's okay but I prefer to use it for night 's out or special events .

Any advice or tips for what would be suitable for me to wear and brands ?

I 'd prefer to keep away from foundation if possible .

I know what you said about foundation , but try Body Shop .

it 's really light , then use a powder brush to put a LIGHT dusting of a pressed powder .

Make sure you remove any make up with a good non greasy cleanser if you do n't want pizza face

Tinted moisturiser gives a little , but imo does n't do much at all and I do n't like the feel and texture on my skin .

I used a Stila one as it was ok , but slightly greasy

Well in the series of Philip Pullman books , the next one in the sequence is called The Subtle Knife , I guess they would make a film of that rather than calling it The Golden Compass 2 .

I imagine they would n't make a sequel because the first film was n't very good .

If they even think of calling it " The Golden Compass 2 ", I will go into Genocide Mode .

It pissed me off enough that they change Northern Lights to The Golden Compass for no apparent reason as it is , let alone ****ing up the rest of the trilogy .

The film sold well in Europe but poorly in America , as a lot of religious groups saw the film as anti @-@ christian @/@ religion and so it got a lot of bad press .

The American market is what matters ( afterall , they took the american title of the book , not the original title ) , so all plans for a sequel were canned .

How can you kill God without any religious context ?

To many fans it 's difficult to see how The Golden Compass could 've even carried the series forward since it left out a lot of the important parts of the Magesterium that is developed in the sequels .

In short , if there is ever to be a Dark Materials Trilogy , it 'll have to be from a British film production company who do n't care what the Bible Belt thinks .

It would 've been nice if someone decided to take it on after the Harry Potter film craze dies down , but since it 's been tried once and failed I think it 's going to be a good few years ( 10 or so ? ) before anyone thinks of touching it again .

Hopefully if it happens they 'll do a Lord of the Rings and film it in one big go rather than wait to see if the box office figures validate a sequel . :/

I do n't either but I can see why he 's doing it .

Depends on the film , I thought it was interesting to see Avatar in 3D , but no other movie since has interested me in 3D ( Harry Potter in 3D is a joke )

On the subject of Star Wars , as a massive fan since I was a child this saddens me as I would like the films to be left as they are . ( Saying that I do agreed with the remastering they did for the 20 th anniversary...)

Though being the whore that I am... I will probably splash the cash to watch Star Wars on the big screen again...

Hollywood money @-@ grabber cashes in while contributing to destroying new technology - shocker .

It would be far more appealing to see those films fully remastered in IMAX , rather than a tacky bandwagon jump , and it would still rake in money .

Without the Force , an after @-@ conversion will never even begin to look good .

If you had six films , which were n't released in their in @-@ universe chronological order originally , would n't you want to change it for any subsequent release ?

The prequels would definitely be improved with 3D , because like Avatar they 're all about spectacle and explosions and the " plot " is really just there to string the spectacle and explosions along for 2 hours .

You can n't tell me you would n't want to see , say , the opening battle in ROTS in 3D ?

That was awesome enough in the cinema anyway , but it could really be enhanced by ILM doing their thang .

I am less optimistic about the core films being convincing in 3D , because as much as I love their visual effects , they were designed 20 years before people even began talking about the possibility of 3D as it has been realised today .

They have held up very well because the story and characters are strong , not because the visual effects are up to much , revolutionary though they were at the time .

It is going to be officially released here in the UK next year in February , but it is going to be shown at the London Film Festival next month .

Hopefully Aronofsky has been able to turn it around , though I 'm not really digging the trailer - Mulholland Drive anyone ?

I really can n't stand that actress because she plays the most annoying characters ever , and her character in Prince of Persia really grates in just the trailers .

I was gonna ask if I was the only one who thought this , but a quick Google search of ' Sex and the City 2 racist ' answers that question .

I do n't think anybody should get on their high horse about it , people only insult it because it 's sex and the city , nobody gives a **** about stuff like that in other films .

I was watching good will hunting and I realised how some of the things in the film apply to me eg pushing yourself away from people because you 're scared that they 'll find you imperfections etc.

That really got me thinking about my life and what i need to change so if you have any films that have changed you personally or have made you change your outlook on life then plz share .

If you 're thinking , think about something useful and interesting which will get you somewhere : maths .

If you do n't want to think , you could get wasted or do something else etc.

If you 're spending your time thinking , make it useful thinking , that 's all I 'm saying .

The Doom Generation . Saw 1 , i know a lot of people got hooked up on the gore and ' sickness ' of it , but the whole point of that film was philosophy about life and it did get me thinking for a while .

And if you 're willing to watch something that is n't a film but still goes in the DVD player , then any of the Bill Hicks stuff

If anyone has n't said The Blind Side yet , then that gets my vote !

I saw the trailer for it and have yet to see the whole thing , but it looks amazing .

And I do n't necessarily think this film is going to make you think hard about life , but.. I also recommend watching Brick .

Cant believe no @-@ one has mentioned Pursuit of Happyness , the only time I have shed a tear infront of the TV since seeing Tottenham loose the Worthington Cup Final when I was 9 .

Serious stuff , this movie is immense and has affected me more then any other film or tv show .

Scrubs is pretty good as well as providing laugh .

I dont know if you genuinely believe this or if you are just trying to act the adult .

The film is classed comedy @-@ drama and is supposedly about the creators and the founding of Facebook .

Facebook has been around for five years now and the question is , does it warrant a film ?

Bit of a stupid idea how film production companies will make a movie about this when there a far better movie scripts out there .

That 's got a better founding story than Facebook .

Are they just trying anything to make it big ?

I personally use Facebook and think it 's a useful thing to have , but to be honest why would I want to see a film about it ?

I like seeing comedies , or thrillers , or action films.. but a film about the founders of Facebook ?

Yeah I heard about that about a year ago when it first went into production .

I 'm really interested to see what comes of it given the cast and ( especially ) David Fincher directing with Aaron Sorkin scripting ! !!

The Academy has announced that they will permit ten nominees for the Best Film category instead of the usual five .

The reason behind the change is that the Academy , in the face of falling ratings , wants to attract more popularity to the Oscars .

What would you do to make the Oscars more popular ?

I think The Dark Knight should have won the Best Film award , but they did n't even nominate that film .

So in the last week , the new head of Ofsted , Sir Michael Wilshaw , has said : “ All teachers should be qualified ”.

You mean to say that , as citizens of this great nation , our children should be taught by professional people who have gone through the necessary rigmarole to be let loose in our schools ?

How dare we expect that from our education system . And while we 're at it - why stop there ?

Let 's round up our homeless and get them working in our hospitals .

Youth unemployment is rife at the moment so let 's get them piloting our aeroplanes .

Heathrow might even get its third runway so we could do with a few more pilots .

Why do n't we just convert the miscreants to our side by giving them a uniform and a gun ?

They 're bound to see sense and start making our streets safer instead of causing the trouble .

And lastly , with the Easter holidays coming up , young children will need something to keep them occupied .

Maybe they can try writing for a Sunday tabloid - I hear there are vacancies at The Sun .

Call me naive , but I always assumed that teachers were either qualified or training alongside someone qualified ?

So despite sounding incredibly obvious , Mr Wilshaw seems to have hit the nail on the head .

I 'm sure it comes as a welcome suggestion to all the fully trained , out @-@ of @-@ work teachers who struggle to get a job .

Not to mention the ones who have jobs and have worked extremely hard to get there .

So until then - if you 're passing by your child 's school , you might want to pop your head around the classroom door .

I think all we need to do is think of some teachers we have had to know this .

And at the same time I think we can all think of great teachers who have not had a piece of paper from a teacher training college .

The second is the special interest group , the teachers unions , who want to keep competition out so they want a piece of paper that teachers need to have .

This piece of paper is just another barrier to entry for outsiders and keeps the incumbent teachers safer from competition .

The teachers unions hate competition and they have done a very good job of fending off competition under the guise of the public interest

Unsurprisingly the most liked comments defend the BNP , the rest all praise the BNP , whether it be in a stealthy way or openly ( most of the " best rated " comments openly support the BNP ) .

I conclude that most of the readers of that paper are BNP sympathisers or supporters .

p.s i would have been for the BNP if they just were n't racist or presented themselves as a " Christian party which support Christian values ", some of their policies e.g " get out of Afghanistan ", " stop being USA 's poodle ", " kick out muslims who dont integrate ", " eradicate Islamic fundamentalism from britian " e.t.c really interest me .

I wish liberals supported the policies i mentioned

While I too think most of their readers are racist , I think for the majority they are more " friendly " racists than " BNP " racists .

By friendly I mean that while they harbour racist views , they are perfectly polite to anyone of any race and do n't go around being openly racist or discriminate against individuals .

Still not a great quality to have , but nowhere near the level of vitriole as the BNP .

I would n't compare them directly to the BNP - most of the readers are white middle class people who find many of the changes in society scary and the Daily Mail gives them stereotypes to blame without using too complicated language .

Whilst it 's an awful paper , comparing its entire readership to some of the monsters in the BNP party is wrong .

If Argentina were to launch a surprise attack and take the island 's airfields , then Britain would be effectively unable to retaliate due to lack of an aircraft carrier .

Argentina launch a surprise attack ?

Well , it would certainly be surprising , not least to the members of their armed forces using the same kit they did in ' 82 .

They 'd be astonished to learn that they had suddenly discovered the requisite experience , training and equipment to make such a landing possible .

Yes , we 're without an aircraft carrier , meaning we cannot retaliate in the same way we did in ' 82 .

However , this does not mean we cannot retaliate .

As a matter of interest to the vegetarians and vegans out there , if it was n't mixed with blood , and was simply stem @-@ cell grown , would you eat it

( I can see why vegans might be opposed , but I 'm unsure about vegetarians )

If it benefited my health then I would probably eat it .

All the things they could research to do with stem cells and they come up with this ?

These people were illegally removed from their homeland to make way for the US military base on Diego Garcia , leased to the US from the UK for a 50 year period , which could be renewed for a further 20 years in 2016 , if the US so wish .

I 'd urge anyone to watch this video for deeper understanding of this atrocity : - http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=1oCqqn_uOiY

If you are short of time please take a few minutes to watch this : - http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qFLhB_SkMIg

After witnessing these events , I hope us educated TSRians have the view that democracy should prevail , and no one should be forcibly removed from their homes .

And PLEASE sign this petition to raise awareness , and hopefully ( yes , being very hopeful here ) it will one day be debated in the House of Commons . http : //epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/4685

I 'll sign the petition if you remove the highlighted part from your post .

You clearly put that there to win brownie points with the anti @-@ war crowd despite this issue having nothing at all to do with the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and infact bomber operations out of Diego Garcia completely ceased over five years ago .

It is important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it 's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for years .

The media condemning bankers is akin to a witch hunt , Stephen Hester was given just a £6.5M bonus in 2010 yet JPMorgan 's top executive was paid $ 21M that year .

Stephen Hester was employed because of his excellent show of skills after his success in safely defusing the explosive capital @-@ market business of Abbey National .

Moral of the story : the media will always present news in a way which forwards their views , it 's that simple .

I recently came across two stories , one about a PCSO in the UK who was arrested and sentenced to up to 10 years for having an " affair " with a 12 year old girl , and another where a woman in Utah was given up to 15 years for having sex with a 14 year old boy .

For the sake of argument , lets say a 35 year old woman was having sex with a 14 year old boy and similarly a 35 year old man was having sex with a 14 year old girl .

I can n't think of a good reason why either of these scenarios should be worse than the other , but deep down i seem to feel that the first scenario is n't that serious at all .

In order to give a reason as to why they are different i 'd have to admit a difference in free will between young guys and girls , which is hard to do .

But for some reason it almost seems like the 35 year old man is some sort of predator whereas the 35 year old woman is only misguided .

In keeping with this the 14 year old girl was taken advantage of whereas the 14 year old boy was lucky .

Note that in both cases the sex was consensual , obviously not legally , but in the sense that there was n't any physical compulsion .

I had a discussion about this with my girlfriend , she thinks both are serious .

I agree , but also seem to have this almost sexist view that the boy was really hurt at all .

I think it seems less serious because 14 @-@ year @-@ old boys talk about having sex with an " older woman " as if it were an achievement .

Whereas to a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl , if an older man was interested in her she 'd consider him a dirty pervert .

Well suppose the 14 year old girl felt the guy loved her and wanted to have sex with him .

It still seems that it 's worse because for some reason i 'd think the man had manipulated her in some way whereas in the other case i would n't really feel the boy had been duped .

I think this is n't a good way to think about it but it seems fairly prevalent .

Girl : " But i wanted sex with him ! " - most would assume she was brainwashed , groomed .

Boy : " But I wanted sex with her ! " - most would assume that yes , he probably did .

Anyone else think it 's a bit ridiculous that this man actually got arrested for making a monkey gesture ?

It did n't hurt anyone , and whilst it may be offensive to some , surely this is n't an arrestable offence ?

I mean , where 's the line between Un @-@ PC and Illegal ?

Whilst no one wants to stop banter , the intention of this was clear : to cause offence .

It was disgraceful and totally unacceptable .

Now , unless I 'm missing something here , I 'm pretty sure Nick Frost is n't black , and monkey means black person , does n't it ?

So what was this detective using the word ' monkey ' for if it was n't to mean black person ?

it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a " 14 year old girl " who was actually an undercover cop...

he did n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?

sure , it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up...

but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it , feeding him along ?

we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this " 14 year old girl " offered him sex on a plate willingly....

i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex...

but fabricating the situation... you can n't arrest someone for something they have n't done... it 's just wrong...

From previous similar stories , what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he shows up at the place then he is guilty .

I see nothing wrong with this morally , he knows the girl is 14 and still decides to meet her ( having previously stated his intentions through IM ) .

if that is the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work , and it 's in america so different laws to here .

They do this and it works , there is even a show about it .

To me its fine , if the suspect has to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then I do n't really care if he is encouraged .

It 's graphic so that is why it is in spoilers .

Strange that youtube keeps it up , but it 's not horrifically graphic like things on liveleak .

Story is basically that they were targeted for refusing to believe in God @/@ Jesus as their saviour .

I 'm not , I 'm just posting it .

Go to the gore websites that dont restrict content and you 'll get so many things about Africa .

There 's nothing to stop these people what they 're doing , either .

I imagine the town is either under the grip of religion , or too scared to protest simply because of the nature of these punishments .

Something that struck me watching a question time debate on this issue was the attitude of some English people , such as the obnoxious Mail journalist on the panel , that Scottish independence was good because then we would n't have to subsidise them for being poor .

Scotland probably receives more than its fair share of UK government spending in terms of its share of the population .

The way some English people sneer at the Scots for being poor and therefore receiving more government spending would n't , I presume , be directed at poor areas of England .

The north , Wales , the south @-@ west , east London and many other areas of the UK get more than their proportional share of spending , because they need it .

I think it 's wrong to resent the Scottish poor for being Scottish , because I 'm sure such complaints would n't be made about poor regions of England .

I was also annoyed by a woman in the audience who said Scotland should be independent ( she was English ) because " all countries should be independent ", including Wales and " Ireland ".

Loads of places have their own histories , cultures , devolved governments , languages and so on .

Just because Scotland was an independent state 300 years ago , does n't mean it should be today .

The definition of " country " is more complex than that woman 's personal black and white judgements .

Culturally I feel British and I want Britain to stay together .

But I recognise there are convincing political and economic reasons the SNP have for independence and I do n't think Lord Ashdown 's reponse on QT of " we 're stronger together " had enough real substance to it .

I support him , but Unionists need to express in more real terms why we 're stronger together .

( Take that sensationalist journalist who has n't got their facts straight ! )

It may well be tactical on the part of the SNP to wait until 2014 , but I think it 's practical too .

It 's the biggest decision in 300 years and it needs to be made slowly I think .

Give the Scots two years to make their minds up , because it 's not as simple as the Westminster government wants to make out .

I do applaud them though for trying to get the legal issues sorted out .

I am so tired of this debate , but I guess it 's going to keep cropping up .

As Scots are we really so different that we 'd toss aside the political , cultural and economic benefits of the union so that we can massage our own egos and yell " FREEDOM ! "?

There was an SNP canvaser at my door today , so my mum decided to annoy him , and told him she voted tory... for which he had no response and got all flustered , then when asked which party she would vote for in the next election she said she did n't vote for a party , she voted for a person , and he got confused , then she said she would n't vote for independence , and he was genuinely surprised and did n't know what to say

The SNP seem to think that just because they won the election it means that the whole country wants independence , when actually they probably won the election because they wanted free prescriptions , free tuition , free care for the elderly etc. while other parties were n't offering as much ( although , it does beg the question of where exactly all this money is coming from ? )

should she have her kid taken away from her ?

You see the other ' British ' woman did n't defend the others but was more concerned with having to take care of her baby that was about to wake up , which means one ' British ' woman was being racist , and the other ' British ' woman was just letting it pass , being more worried about something else .

You also have to admit that the lady arguing with the raving bitch had no reason to say ' We 're here because you do n't work , go find a job ', that 's wrong and a bit racist within itself .

The like to dislike ration on this video is around 3 @:@ 1 , what does that show ?

If you allow her to have this opinion is it because you project the same feelings ?

The women is so steeped in her own ignorance it would take years to educate her

She 's entitled to her own opinion .

Someone should have just given her a slap just to shut her up

But seriously , if all English @/@ British people were like her.....why would anyone WANT to be English/British .

I actually think she has something wrong with her , whether she is on drugs or drunk .

The fact she called Nigeria... Nygigreeah.... I think she was half with it...

No @-@ one in their right mind , starts screaming and swearing like that , with their young child sat on their lap...

I 'm a British woman and would never dream of acting like that .

1. She actually did , by telling the loud mouthed cow to shut up .

2. Although she should n't have to , why do you think she has to get involved ?

3. Several other people , who were n't British did n't get involved... does that make them racist too..?

4. If I were in that situation , and I had a child with me , I would try my hardest not to get involved , as it would n't be fair on my child .

But if the arguing caused my child to be disturbed , then I would have done the same and got involved .

I agree that what I have watched in this video is sickening , but I disagree with several points you have made .

You may be angry at what you have seen , but that is NO reason to group all British women as racist .

Seems stabbing is becoming as regular as farting , soon there will be so many knives on the streets it will bring back the UK 's steel making to what it was 50 years ago .

Along with tougher sentancing I dont know what else could be done that would'nt upset the bleeding heart liberals ( no pun intended )

I would rather be stabbed by a childish fool than be harassed by the police on a daily basis .

EDIT : I will clarify - I would rather take the risk of being stabbed than have my freedom infringed on a regular basis .

did u know statistically ethnic minorites are more than likely to be stopped and searched .

Just saying that this kind of measure to stop and search anyone @- i do n't really see as appropriate .

Recently France decided to ban the burka in public places in the interest of public security .

I both agree and disagree with this statement .

Some women feel the burka empowers them , but other feel trapped by it .

Intimidating or forcing one into dressing a particular way is wrong .

It has been said that if teenages cannot wear hoodies in shops as it conceals their identity why should somebody to wear a burka ?

I 'm a Muslim and I did n't agree with much of what he said , but I can n't deny that he was a fantastic orator .

Whether you agree with his views or not , you have to respect the man 's incredible intellect and sharp wit .

I happen to agree with his views on religion and so I must thank him for teaching me an incredble amount of factual knowledge but more importantly , the ability to think critically .

I do n't have any Johnnie Walker so I hope a glass of this JD will suffice .

Thank you for everything Hitch .

I was a Hitchens fanboi for a year or so and the fact this is actually really quite upsetting is a testament to just how good his writing is , that he can have such an incredible impact on peoples lives .

Even the guy above who is a glad he is dead has been seduced by the Hitch 's writing in that you either devote yourself to him or hate him above all else .

( That guy is obviously far too stupid to comprehend this though guys so best to just ignore him )

I was n't such a fan of his habit of preaching opinion as truth , then again I 'm not a big fan of rhetoric in general .

Nevertheless , he exercised his right to freedom of speech to the nth degree and gave a lot of people strength in the process .

We need more people that go out of their way to challenge the " false refuge of consensus " he has referred to and warned against seeking .

On Reagan : " He 's doing to the country what he can no longer do to his wife ."

On a TV evangelist : " If you gave him an enema you could bury him in a matchbox ."

I may have supported his anti @-@ religiousness but , whatever your opinion on it , you have to admire the courage of his convictions .

He only said what he thought was right and , if we had more people around today like that ( namely in politics ) , the world would be a better place .

When I heard about his death this morning my mood completely shifted .

His writings and speeches were such a huge influence on me during those most tumultuous teenage years , the years in which I was " tentatively feeling my way into the life of the freethinker " in the words of Dawkins , and served as a brilliant rebuttal to the dogma I was being fed in Catholic school .

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hitchens at the " Great God Debate " last year here in Boston and in retrospect , I 'm glad I had that opportunity before his untimely , yet nonetheless inevitable demise .

what are the chances that TM when we wake up in the morning , we switch on to the news and see breaking news that prince Philip has died after overnight heart problems

I pray for his swift recovery and many more years of life and service to the UK and Commonwealth .

Much as I am fond of the Royal Family if he dies I really hope we do n't end up seeing a load of scenes that would not look out of place in North Korea and a Media circus .

It is about time someone reminded all these naive women that no matter what your " rights " are , you still have to take responsibility for your safety or sadly face the consequences .

EDIT : So... 87 96 people would risk being raped rather than getting a taxi ?

Well do n't come crying to TSR when you get a reality check .

It 's a sad fact of our society that you have to think ahead all the time to ensure your safety .

It should n't be - you should be able to dance down backalleys naked , drunk at 3 in the morning if you wanted to without anyone trying to cause you harm , but unfortunately there are always those who will take advantage , so you should always watch your drinks , stay within your limit and never ever wander off on your own .

Why are we telling women not to get raped instead of telling men not to rape ?

You can n't always afford a taxi ( especially if you 're in London ! ) , you can n't always flag one down , you might not have a working phone on you ( lack of credit , lack of battery ) and you might have a phone but no idea of local taxi numbers .

Does this mean you deserve to be raped ?

The point here should be ' if you see a woman walking alone at night , do n't rape her ' as opposed to ' if you 're a woman , or have any chance of being perceived as one , do n't walk around alone at night '.

It is easier for men not to rape than women not to be raped .

EDIT : I seem to have been misconstrued by a couple of people here , so I 'll elaborate .

Women have a responsibility to mitigate the risk of bad things happening to them , like any of us .

If a girl is raped , it is not her fault even if she did n't take the adequate measures to mitigate risk , because that risk would have been there irrespective of how careful she may have been .

Rape victims do not have the power to prevent rape .

Women should not be made to feel bad for having been raped .

Now if these lot rioting and looting were South Asians or , god forbid Muslims , forum would be filled with anti @-@ Multiculturalism rhetoric - where derogative comments about an entire group of people would be acceptable .

Often these people would decry the " PC liberal media " for not calling it out .

So , we all know the crime problems in the black community in London , why are n't you calling it out as an example of Multiculturalism failing ?

You 're probably thinking it , but do n't want to say it .

Heaven forbid , have you become politically correct overnight ?

They are : I do n't know about TSR , but you should look at the comments on the Telegraph website .

Mind , they do n't need much encouragement .

Most of the past riots have been majorly white , nobody starts banging on about race then and they should n't .

I 've seen a lot of racism today and its unacceptable .

The only countries that would be able to implement this already have birth rates below replacement ( or will do soon )

The only area of real population growth in the future is going to be Africa , and I can n't imagine any African states being able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizens .

Most of the words that come out of his mouth these days seem to be trying to lure catholic votes .

It seems that he knows under the current population changes ( if it continues ) that Ireland will eventually unite .

But how can he possibly ' end sectarianism ' if members of his party come out with purely bigotory remarks ( such as Ian McMrea 's in the summer time )?

It seems that such a beautiful land had been created that it had to be balanced out , so it was sent the most evil of inhabitants to curse the land forever...

I think it 's a noble aspiration and , yes , unionists need to reach out to Roman Catholics .

There 's nothing ideologically unsound about that - after all , most Roman Catholics in Scotland , England and Wales are Unionists , why should history prevent that from being the case in Northern Ireland ?

I 've not heard his full remarks , just what I garnered from the radio and a couple of short bits in articles , but it really sounded good and - whilst I still can n't bring myself to think of the DUP as decent , mainstream and cross @-@ community - I think it 's a step in the right direction .

However , if the majority want to keep up a Union with Great Britain then that 's fine .

It really is n't very good looking is it . Even from a distance .

Kinda looks like a rollar coaster with some ugly grey tower going up the middle of it .

I dont think there is anything wronge with the except for the name of the program ; " Mumifying Alan "

He agreed to do it .

The best abled pupils get put into the " top " set and usually get the best teacher in the subject department etc.

Really , what was the point in the government making me eat lunch in the same room as violent yobo 's anyway and having to watch out for being attacked in the hall way or fireworks snuck in ?

I feel like they were just trying to piss me off , and I kind of am , at them and the socialists who push for this kind of crap .

There was one not far from me but it 's just a regular middle @/@ high school now .

Where I 'm from 10 % of children will pass the 11+ and get into the grammar school .

The other 90 % are called failures at 11 and sent to an underfunded sink school .

Why is it fair that 10 % of children get 90 % of the funding ?

Grammar schools also do n't allow for children to move up if they start working harder , it 's much easier to move from the bottom set to the top set within a school than it is to move from the comprehensive to the grammar school .

Everyone deserves the chance for a good education not just the lucky 10 % who get into the grammar school based on one exam at the age of 11 .

If we wanted oil contracts why would we bother with this ?

We should have just supported Gaddafi and he would have rewarded our support with more oil contracts .

Oh and just because there are reserves it does not mean they are financially viable , plus the TNC could just tell us to **** off like Iraq did .

The UK 's Share of loot will be minumum , but BP will make a killing its investments are safe it has avoided a long drawn out civil war .

Unless you meant something different , BP went back into profit only a few months after the Gulf of Mexico spill .

I 'm kinda slow , I have n't been following the news for the past couple of days .

I log into TSR and am greeted by loads of threads about how it 's all kicking off in London ( and a few scuffles in Brum too ) but no explanation how they started then I go to the BBC site to try and get to the bottom of it but still no explanation !

Basically , a guy got shot in London , police claim he was a gangbanger and shot a police officer , local people claim he was innocent .

Anyways , this killing led to a riot in Tottenham and people realised they could just break down shop windows and take what they want , and burn cars without being held accountable .

Basically , a man called Mark Duggan was shot to death on Thursday reportedly by police , a bunch of people staged a peaceful protest and from that people have started using violence , looting and setting buildings on fire , and it 's getting worse because they 're realising that police can n't do anything about it .

I live right in the middle of this crap , and I know of the sort of people who 're getting involved , and it really just boils down to some entitled pricks who 've realised that the police won't stop them from nicking things they want if they do it simultaneously , morality be damned .

That incident might have been the spark , but believe me on this , mate , there is no cause behind it anymore .

Most of the trouble around London is copy cat violence of what happened in tottenham where a 29 year old was shot by the police sparking of a protest which gott out of control .

People saw the looting going on and wanted some themselves therefore organising a riot .

Riot police , police dogs and police helicopters confirmed .

i work in argos and apparently it hasnt even been touched it was just the old college and barton street and woolworths .

Enfield , Brixton , Chingford , Walthanstow , Dalston.....all being looted...all being set on fire .

Ive just emailed all the big news agencies making them aware that we know they are hiding this......

doubt i 'll get a reply , or anything will change on the news .

I think in the middle of all this carnage , everybody needs to take a step back and just hug the internet .

They focus on shops being burnt late in the evening but not violence at a family @-@ friendly festival etc

I do n't think that we 'll see any substantive impact in the City unless the riots do actually spread from the periphery to the Docklands , or even the Square Mile itself which I consider very unlikely .

It 's going to hit tourism really badly .

Tourists are n't going to want to go to a city that 's unsafe where the police can allow mob rule in the streets for three consecutive nights , and understandably so .

If you put your business here , it will not be treated with respect , it may be destroyed , clearly we do n't have the money to buy your products '.

If i were a foreign investor right now , I 'd be looking elsewhere .

I 'm not his biggest critic by any means , but this is the most out of touch thing Cameron has said so far IMO .

The country wants unemployed people to have jobs , not be forced to work for nothing .

You would have to be insanely right @-@ wing to describe anyone who thinks people should be paid for work as a Trotskyite .

Secret tip on how to avoid this ' slave labour ': When they ask if you want to do it , say no.

It is if you say yes and quit before completion then you lose benefits for 2 weeks ( if an 8 week scheme ) .

However , something has gone wrong in the way the job centre have been portraying it to some people , making it seem mandatory .

yes , although I 'd like to see a change from first past the post to proportional representation .

People point to the inherited monarchy and the llife peerage as signs of not being democratic , but ignore one significant thing :

Many other democratic countries worldwide do not elected their Head of State or their Upper House .

For example : Germany , Italy , Canada , Australia , Japan , Holland , Spain , Belgium , Sweden , Norway , Denmark , Czech Republic , Hungary , Greece and many others do not elect the Head of State .

Likewise , Ireland , Canada , Germany , France , Holland , Jamaica and many others do not elect their Upper House - at least not directly .

Firslty the Chamber , although it has party politics , is kept in balance so it is not as partisan as the commons .

Thirdly these guys are lifers , which means they are able to think past the next election for the good of the country .

I have far more faith in the Lords as it stands than in the FPTP house of commons which leads to barracking by two parties who are becoming increasingly differentiated only by the spelling .

[Reposting as a replacement for my last post which broke the rules by posting a video only]

Do you think it might have something to do with the fact that 70 % of the people of these islands do not want this mass immigration yet our government allows million from very different cultures to immigrate to these islands .

Do you think it is just a co @-@ incidence that some foul mouth racists stand up and deliver some foul mouth speech or do you think that this is symptomatic of the fact that the British people have had enough of immigration and this is the start of revolt .

The rights of the British white population do n't really need championing .

Where they happen they become viral videos and even make the newspapers .

They evidently are quite angry that they do n't have much money and therfore take their anger out on other races and point the blame on them...

I 'd respect what she said if she did n't call me a "****ing foreign ****head ".

because they are uninformed and support the BNP .

Okay , not trolling or anything but i have a question .

Why ? I understand what both the BNP and EDL want in terms of aspirations and goals , ive studied policies and many responses to them .

But from what i 've observed via TSR and many news sources ; the way they 're trying to achieve them , is largely violent EDIT : specific coverage of EDL , whom seem to make the headlines a little more .

Aggression and hostility is obviously the worst way to go about to get these changes made .

I 've seen very little peaceful protests go on , which causes me to question the validity of both the BNP and EDL .

And whether they 're genuinely thinking for the better of this country or they just house people who just want a fight , that have the option to jump on the bandwagon of UK politics . Hence this thread .

I 'm not blaming anyone , im largely trying to remain neutral .

But , im just trying to get a bigger picture here .

I 'd like for this to be a calm discussion and an informative thread .

For members and followers of both the EDL and BNP to come and justify their points across so , not just i , but many others can be educated properly on the intentions and the reasoning behind it all . Regards .

First of all , I have no affiliation with the BNP , I find them ridiculous .

I mean , aside from the couple of mental members in the past , I have n't seen much violence coming from BNP members .

But an agressive opposition , along with a biased press and press with an agenda make them out to be a lot worse than they are .

The majority are loutish and do n't have any great intellectual capacity , but that does n't mean you should write them off , or that you should oppose their aims .

People who do n't think the BNP are violent do n't know **** about the history of the BNP .

Yeah they wear suits now , but in the 80 s and early 90 s it was n't a political ' party ', it was just a street gang that used to fight with AFA and commit random acts of violence and vandalism against non @-@ whites .

You can n't change that history by appearing on Question Time .

And before anyone storms in with the negs and the ' that 's just slander where 's the evidence of this ', Google is your friend , do your own research on the BNP vs AFA and the links between the BNP and the NF , Combat 18 , National Socialist Movement etc etc etc

With the Scottish vote generally being a Labour vote ( 41 of 59 seats ) would losing Scotland give The Conservative party a clear advantage ?

As well as this the forthcoming boundary changes will see Labour lose 28 seats compared to 7 for The Conservatives , not to mention union donation caps that would decrease party funding for Labour .

With all the said , and with Conservatives likely to hold a natural majority if Scotland gain independence , would that cause Labour to push further to the right in order to try and steal the Conservative vote and effectively leave behind the working class ?

I am interested in hearing peoples opinions on this .

Unsure tbh , maybe would make the UK slightly more right wing but can n't imagen it becoming majorly right .

Conservatives won a majority of the vote ( but not a majority of the seats , hmm ) in England in 2005 and no doubt many more elections where Labour won in the UK .

What I find worrying is that you think it is OK for a political party to change its core values and ideals , purely for the sake of gaining power .

Not because they believe in what they are saying .

I 'm not saying that it does n't happen already , but you seem to be implying that it is a totally understandable thing to do ?

Anyway , my personal opinion is that Labour are n't truly left wing and the Conservatives definitely are n't right wing .

As a ' right wing ' person (*cringe*), I sympathise more with some Conservative policies but I do n't really like their leadership .

Good riddance if they loose their foothold in English politics .

Immigration does need to reflect surplus jobs available .

However , you get people like that girl suing the government for making her work in poundland not making things better for anyone .

whilst in some cases this is true half the time these people do the work the rest of the british refuse to do...

persay street cleaners as a prime example i cant remember the last time i saw a brit doing it yet people whine about the ' evil foreigners taking our jobs '

if they wouldnt be so anally retentive in what they wished to do .

and on the broader issue thats what you get for joining the EU you win some you loose some , simple .

basically with all this fuss about Scottish Independence in the news I 'm wondering how this bears for people who are n't 100 % ' pure blooded Scot ' for 7 generations or something .

I dunno why but it just boggles my brain .

If the SNP get their way and crown Salmond as king of his own private domain , who determines who is and is n't Scottish ?

EU work and residency rights no longer apply following independence , and I can see this potential event doing nothing but fuelling xenophobia , racism and nasty nationalism .

Many English people have Scottish relatives or relatives living in Scotland long term , many Scots move down to England , marry English people or have English relatives .

Who decides if they 're Scottish or not ?

People who have lived in Scotland for decades could potentially find themselves aliens in their own homes , potentially considered foreign or ' not quite native '.

What about people who consider themselves British living in a British territory suddenly find themselves on the ' wrong ' side of the border ?

Residents of other EU countries would suddenly find themselves without EU protections either .

Why is the SNP so obsessed with independence when there is no real political or economic mandate for it ?

Scotland gains nothing but gets lumped with stupid debt and political fallout , loss of influence and still economically and culturally tied to the rest of the UK as to make an international border seem utterly insane .

It 's ironic that some Scots take issue with the United Kingdom while ignoring that Scotland was created in much the same fashion .

Someone that has a heritage that clearly shows that the family have been in Scotland for a long time they are Scottish obviously although I am sure that someone born there would also be considered Scottish as well ?

the only people who are not Scottish would be those who move there à la not born there or have any previous family who were born in Scotland .

As for who decides that could be tricky although I doubt it will be much of an issue .

It would n't really matter if someone is a Scottish citizen or a UK citizen , because they will have equal rights in both countries .

Right now Irish citizens can freely live in the UK and can vote in general elections and even run for office .

It does still raise the question of exactly who can get Scottish citizenship , but it won't really make any practical difference to people who do n't qualify for it .

Scottish citizenship would probably be open to people living in Scotland on the day it becomes independent , and anyone who has at least one grandparent who was born there , or something like that .

Look at Irish citizenship laws , it would probably end up being quite similar .

I was born in Scotland to parents who were born and raised in England , but then my mothers side ( she 's an Anderson ) has a long history of Scottish ancestry .

I lived there till I was four , but have lived the rest of my life in England .

I imagine I will be able to apply for Scottish citizenship , but will I be able to vote in a referendum ?

In recent times and quite a bit more in the past it has always been heavily played on that UK prisoners are some if the most expensive people to keep in the UK .

So I was thinking , why are n't we making the people who have the ability to pay ( ie @- those people who have any sort of savings or credits ) to stay in prison ?

Some prisoners are in prison with large amounts of money in the bank so why are n't we taking money back off of these people to cover the costs involved in keeping them and court costs ?

If people commit the crime people should be willing to do the time and the people who can afford it , should pay for it surely ?

Yeah man totally agree man they should register to a Student Loan alternative man and then like , sort of pay it off after their time in jail innit , i 'm gonna buy the domain PrisonLoans.co.uk now before anybody else smart steals it

The law should treat everyone equally - You can n't have some people paying and others not .

However this also raises the issue that since they are paying money as well as serving their time in jail , their sentence should be reduced .

If this were to happen , would it not be unfair that other prisoners that do not have the means to pay and have committed ' lesser ' crimes have to serve longer than those that can ' buy ' their way out of jail , so to speak ?

Personally I think it 's a very good thing , since our NHS should be working to treat all of the world 's sick people and the more diseased immigrants we have , the more good it can do for them .

Also , having them living among us massively increases the risk of infection for the general population , making for a fair society .

Testing immigrants as a condition of entry to the UK would set us back decades and is morally wrong anyway .

What do we do with them quarantine them while we wait on test results ?

Surely , as a matter of common sense , if we get plenty of people from countries where diseases like HIV and TB are rife , it 's best to test for it and treat them upon arrival ?

The problem is that you 'd have to pay to deport immigrants who fail the tests when they refuse to leave of their own accord .

So , I 've been reading about Scottish independence and I do n't think it 's fair to solely concentrate on Scottish independence and I 'd like to get the overall views of TSR members .

On the one hand , the union gives us a bigger economy and population , and if it broke up we 'd be less powerful .

So I disagree with the whole Tory ethos , and can n't stand what they 're doing to this country out of sheer idealogy blahblahblah...

But the reason I really can n't stand Cameron and his current cabinet is that they are constantly trying to pull the wool over the publics eyes .

Whether it 's by saying all those in the public sector who will be striking on Wednesday are selfish , or by Osbourne selflessly wiping the VAT on the X @-@ Factor charity single , conveniently being named live on X Factor infront on millions of viewers .

Likewise when services had to shut down after a day because of snow , the media launched a full blown attack and everyday people were saying how disgusting it was .

If any of you have even used the NHS and have lived @/@ travelled abroad for a period of time , you will probably know how lucky we are to have such an amazing health service .

There was absolutely no need to open it up to private firms , and he swore blind in those televised debates that his party would n't touch our NHS .

It 's been almost 17 months since the coalition has been in now , not 15 months as one of you said , or just 6 months as another one of you said

So blaming Labour for the world recession ( which by the way would have been even worse had the Tories been in gov in the same years ) almost 17 months on where our economy has gone backwards in terms of economic growth from when Labour left office , is ridiculous .

How many more years are you going to use it as an excuse for what is essentially a Tory government dismantling the public sector while it can get away with it .

Public sector workers being singled out to pay more into their pension funds...

My sister is a primary school teacher and teachers generally hate the tories , before all this pension business came to the surface but because they 're so backward when it comes to education .

She has to pay out of her own wages for all her teaching activites @/@ reading books/teaching supplies and only has a teaching assistant twice a week now because they 've withdrawn so much money from the school budget .

She 's a great teacher so buys all that stuff , whereas a lot of teachers might not bother as to be fair why should they have to spend hundreds a year ? !

Why won't the people of this country wake up and stop allowing Cameron to brainwash them ? ??

You need not to tell us why , as we already know .

We are like this because of financial issues out of our control and the mess of the last government .

You can hardly call the NHS shake up sneaky .

How dare we bring Public Sector pensions more into line with the Private sector ?

There are no other choices , the Public sector have been spared this by 13 years of spineless Labour government , but the fact is we cannot take this burden on at the expense of the tax payer any longer .

whilst I agree that D Cameron and the tories are n't doing everything they said they would , they are trying to cut back the welfare state and dismantle some of the ridiculous laws that stop businesses and workers from operating at their highest

OP trying to win brownie points from other clueless students who hate the Conservative party just because .

Why ? Because the wonderful Labour party pissed away trillions on trying to create a client state .

This comes the same week that reports ( costing the taxpayer millions ) are finally published , having been commissioned by Labour , but never released due to their findings which basically concluded that Labour made the worst mistakes imaginable on immigration .

Food prices are generally not the domain of the government , and the food prices in the UK are relatively low compared to continental Europe - certainly the Eurozone .

How about a doctor or nurse that does n't actually have any patients ?

At a stroke , by taxing dividends he destroyed private pensions , costing countless trillions , but benefiting the treasury a few billion which he whizzed away on social engineering .

No one believes that . Cameron is part of a coalition government , and faces widespread opposition from the likes of you , and hard @-@ liners in his own party .

I would suggest also that large numbers of people in Britain are also resigned to the fact that the country had its back broken during the tenure of Blair and Brown .

except OP explained exactly why they hate the tories...

Why would you call anybody " scum " for holding a moderate political view ?

Around 2 % of British people are mixed race .

Coupled with mass immigration , established immigrants having children , and white flight .

Tony Blair defended his immigration policies a couple of months back and I have to say I agree with him .

I 've always viewed immigration 's goal was to try change Britain 's demographics and making it a fairer society in the long run .

To those anti @-@ immigrant nationalists who hate this , look at Obama , probably one of the most popular human beings of all time , if not the most popular ever .

A lot of people like him for his charisma , his charm , his looks , his speeches even , I and many others also like him for his ethnicity ( sorry but I do it 's healthy for the world ) .

Obama 's mixed race background highlights humanities love for mixed race people and our destiny to wanting to become mixed race .

And Obama as a figure head and his popularity proves that .

So Tony Blair was right about immigration , and we are becoming more diverse thankfully , like America , because of it .

And maybe one day too we will have our own Obama .

Thank you Tony Blair .

Where Tony Blair and his government got it wrong was in underestimating the number who would migrate from the new countries in the EU , and not then providing the resources to support this , for example in English language support in schools .

For non @-@ EU migrants and those seeking to live in the country , the support and resources to enable decisions on their future to be made in a short period of time .

Depends on if you believe Blair did it for electoral reasons or not .

Immigration is good for a society , but opening the floodgates like he did is quite frankly dangerous .

OP spend a year in Luton and tell us all of this .

Besides , it 's funny how you talk about America like it 's improved lately .

It 's going down the toilet...........even more so by the day .

As for Blair , he only welcomed all these new people because not him nor his mates have to live with them .

I think immigration levels are high , and our past pm 's like gordon brown think that talking about high immigration is bigoted .

i have to say i disagree .

my father comes from an immigrant background , and i dont think am bigoted for wanting to see lower immigration levels .

i also think its stupid that our european friends can immigrate to britian and seek benefits , and denying them that would be against " human rights "....according to the eu court of human rights .

Am i racist and bigoted for these views ?

Everybody knows the rate of immigration is too high but it 's not really what you say , just how you say it .

Your beliefs do n't stem from believing your race is superior , or that immigrants or other races are inferior , but ' your racism ' is arguable in regards to prejudice , discrimination and antagonism ( also part of racism ) .

Not saying that you are , I am saying that is open to question and has grounds depending on how you go about these beliefs .

For example , if you made an unjust distinction of someone because they are an immigrant , not quite sure if that would make you a fully fledged racist , but it certainly would be discrimination .

Sucks but life is sometimes politically correct , but you have to learn to deal with it because you never know when you 're the one going to be on the other side of the spectrum .

OK , so I am still learning about how the free market/ global energy supply system works so please correct me if I am wrong , but here is my suggestion ;

All state services including social housing , libraries , hospitals , schools , prisons etc should be powered by British energy only and everything the state uses ( construction materials , food etc ) should be British produced , grown and maintained by a British workforce .

The private sector can do pretty much whatever it wants but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the private sector .

People who choose to live on benefits ( rely on the state ) will only have access to British resources also .

( British grown ) food will be provided for survival as will housing and energy but ( imported ) luxuries will not be available to those dependent on the state .

If people desire luxury , then they must work for it .

The idea being that the state pays ( modest ) salaries for its workers who consume British energy ( retrieving this money through taxes from British workers ) and British food/ materials .

This would effectively create a system which circulated resources within the country rather than it being channelled out into the hands of Russian billionaires .

I 'm trying to offer a solution to a problem .

So no library books from non @-@ British authors ?

Also not too sure why you do n't think pensioners should be allowed to buy themselves a bottle of champagne for their 80 th birthday party either .

Your ideas are crazy and would mean the death of the free market .

You have to let the free market work .

if the people want British goods they will buy British goods .

If they want foreign goods they will buy those instead ,

it certainly is n't in the States interest to increase costs substantially by going exclusively for British goods of all kinds ,

they should go for the cheapest best quality goods instead .

You cannot force suppliers to sell products for no profit

( they would simply move abroad where they can sell 100 % of their product at a profit ) .

Here 's the crucial fact : we import more FROM other EU member states than we export TO them .

Any tariffs they impose would hurt French , German , Spanish and Italian businesses more than it would hurt us .

The EU is fundamentally committed ( this is stated in one of its treaties I believe ) to fostering good relations and free trade with non @-@ members , especially those which maintain high standards of human rights and democracy ( now ain't that ironic ) .

So if we left the EU , we could negotiate free trade agreements individually with the union and its members ; we could join @/@ remain in the EEC ; or we could join the EFTA ( EEC @-@ lite ) .

We 'd have a range of options , all of which would keep our trade with Europe strong and healthy .

Will politicians in Germany and France want to stop Brits from buying up their countries ' BMWs , Mercs , Audis , VWs , Peugeots , Renaults , and so on ?

I very highly doubt it - not a vote @-@ winner .

As well as maintaining our trade levels , if we left the EU we could save the several billion pounds we donate to the EU each year , reduce immigration to more viable levels , and shun some of the more overbearing aspects of EU bureaucracy , all of which would benefit our economy substantially .

Oh , and I forgot to mention that it 's predicted that the EU 's share of world trade and prosperity is going to massively decline over the coming decades .

So why is everyone terrified of leaving because of trade ?

The EU probably deflects as much trade as it creates .

Because we are part of the EU we trade more with members of the EU , such as Germany , France , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Greece and Ireland because we have a common market .

I am not convinced we want to attatch ourselves to the overly indebted nations of Europe .

However as part of the EU you do get the appreciable benefit of free trade within the EU area .

However it is starting to look like the members of the monetary union are going to try and exploit the common market member ones eg . The Tobin Tax .

I agree with the Europhiles that it 's important to trade and work together so the people of Europe can collectively raise their standard of living , it 's just that the EU has proven to be a corrupt power hungry entity that has a socialist doctrine at it 's core so it 's not an ideal long term trading partner .

It 'd be like relying on the USSR to provide you with economic stability .

The Government has absolutely no right to say what I can and can n't do with my body , as well as what I put in it .

We should be helping those who use drugs , not punishing them .

You could make the point that by making drugs legal and creating potentially a bigger market for their use that food crops could be replaced in developing countries for drug crops much like the increase of demand for bio fuel has done , thus increasing food prices making impoverished people even poorer and increasing inflation of food products which are bad for most consumers so drugs actually have a massive impact on none drug users !

The problem with both of us is that neither of us specified which drugs we are talking about .

Some drugs such as heroin are clearly awful - I certainly hope that you agree it is addictive and does harm others .

Some drugs have much less of a negative effect on the individual and other people around them .

Cannabis being mentally addictive is still addiction .

I believe that drug addicts should be forced to enrol on some sort of a program which is created to help them whether that would be in prison or otherwise .

I think we 're all for legalizing drugs until you meet the poor guys @/@ gals who are n't from middle class @/@ higher class families and can n't afford rehab ( this coming from a lower @-@ middle class guy ) who are sleeping on the streets in the winter in the snow before eventually dying .

Drugs are n't good and are n't necessary , and ruin tons of peoples lives .

I have used drugs in the past and will probably do so sometime in the future , but it should n't be legalized .

If you want to get philosophical , I will tell you what I believe to be the most detrimental effect of any recreational drug .

Hence , drugs are an artificial substitute for a natural incentive that has evolved to motivate our species to do what necessary for it 's survival .

Recreational drugs are a waste because it is counter productive to nature , to society , and to your personal growth to have access to undeserved bliss .

If we were capable of producing a drug which induced intense euphoria , with no side effects , no adverse health risks , and was infinitely available , It would be catastrophic to our society .

It is easy for drug users to delude themselves into believing that the health risks are minimal when they are partying and having so much fun .

We are not naturally meant to feel that good without achieving something to improve our existence .

I already know the kinds of responses I 'm going to get to this thread , almost by definition , because as far as I can tell you can split the English public into two groups when it comes to Scottish independence ; a majority who do n't care above some vague notion that Scotland probably costs them money , and a very vocal swivel eyed unionist minority for whom Scottish independence marks the beginning of the end of their pseudo @-@ colonial ambitions .

So I want to ask that crowd , and I already know they are going to be chomping at the bit to just click reply already , but I specifically want to know what it is you want out of the Union ; I do n't want to hear about how Scotland would be worse off somehow etc. etc. just why you want the UK to remain the UK and not split .

I think it would be nice if we stayed unionised and strong .

But really , if Scotland really wants out , then let them **** off , because the whole point in such a union ( IMO ) is that it 's voluntary and agreeable to all parties .

Scotland should remain as part of the union .

As for ' English people ' - the attitude generally seems to be one of ' let the scots decide , but I would be sad to see the United Kingdom dismantled .'

Personally , I think it 's best to let the Scots have their independence within 5 years , but before such plans are published we should drill for all the oil they have and use it to pay off our debts .

After that if there are any remaining debts they should be given around 1 @/@ 3 of it .

As I was writing a post in another topic earlier about Russia and their right to be a superpower , my mind rambled a bit and I started to wonder if Great Britain can ever become a political superpower on the international stage again .

90 years ago , the British Empire was accountable for approximately 25 % of the entire worlds population , and Britain had control of 25 % of the worlds landmass , therefore being able to completely dictate trade routes and international relations .

In 2008 , Great Britian controls very little in the way of overseas territories , and have a population of only 58,000,000 residents , many having moved into the UK from other countries .

We also seem to be losing the ability to defend ourselves politically , being subservient to the United States in their quest to capture resources , and being a part of the European Union , often have to accept group decisions that the country does not agree with or benefit from in any way .

So , with all this in mind , can Britain ever become a superpower again if desired ?

I know that we clearly will never compete with China in terms of population , but is there any way to maximise the economic power of the nation in order to compete in terms of financial position and ability to develop and expand faster and more sustainably than other nations ?

You could make a case for the UK being a financial superpower , we punch way above our weight politically and we have one of the best trained militaries in the world .

Yet superpower in the old sense of the word , basically being a colonial or military superpower , is something I think is out of our reach for very obvious and in my opinion desirable reasons .

The best way the UK can stay on the world stage is doing what it does now , being pretty much the top in the service industries .

I think monopolistic power tends to corrupt and is almost invariably abused .

Why do you care , Ian ?

I hope this is n't some jingoist nonsense .

That is those who develop the best and most efficient renewable @/@ readily accessible power source and are completely self sufficient on it .

I mean most of Europe has the same currency , laws and you do n't need a visa to travel between each country .

They encourage high fares so that they can make profit , but do very little to invest in the network ultimatly leaving Britain with the highest rail fares in Europe with one of the poorest services .

Privatisation in Britain was supposed to encourage competition and therefore drive drown fares but I do n't see how competition on the railways works as each company usually has a monopoly on the route they serve

( Eg . If you want to go from Nottingham to London you can only use the East midlands Trains )

So , do you think that we should re @-@ nationalise the railways and base the network on the French @-@ German model of low fares and high quality ? I certainly do !

What happened to that company that walked away from one of it 's franchises a couple years back ?

I remember the government ( Lord Adonis I think ) said it was going to be punished , did anything ever happen ?

Financially it may not be viable at present , but nationalisation ought to be a long term aim .

Privatising the railways was arguably the worst thing the Tories did .

I support deregulation , and I am completely opposed to nationalisation .

in a time of economic downturn , you want to nationalise the rail network so the public sector ( who is already faced with billions of pounds worth of cuts ) has to finance the entire network , including maintenance , investment and subsidies ? No thanks !

Deregulation or Privatisation FTW.....or even just how it is right now....our rail network is n't that bad to be brutally honest ,

it gets you from A to B , sure there might be a few delays before you get to C , but you 'll get there in the end

How long can Cameron keep smoothing the ruffled feathers of his party ?

It was n't really a Lib Dem victory , the general population was wholly against it from the beginning .

Nick should stick to weeping to Celine Dion .

So we 've all been hearing a lot about super @-@ injunctions being littered all over the news , although one thing has struck me , that applies in almost all other European countries apart from us : The defendant is always anonymous until proven guilty .

I think that until the defendant is proven to be guilty , they should be completely anonymous , to prevent false arrests getting out into public and denting one 's reputation , as it is almost a form of defamation .

I do n't think it 's fair that cases are so publicized , and should only be so open if the defendant does n't mind .

It is weird how people proven to be innocent are still hated because of the accused crime , like the stigma of being called a paedophile even though it can literally happen to anyone and everyone .

If you look at that Joanna Yeates case , everyone had decided that landlord was guilty up to the point where people hated him and the media was slaughtering him .

Not that the media owed him an apology or anything

Can we find out here which voting system will benefit ( increase the power enjoyed by ) small , " extreme " parties like the BNP and Greens , with an explanation ?

Do n't vote for AV because you think it will help one party more than another .

Vote for AV because you think it will be more fair . If AV results in more BNP MPs , because more people in our country support the BNP , I think that 's fair enough .

Honestly I hate these freaking ' Vote AV and the Tories won't get in ! ' arguments , they 're so idiotic and not even true .

UK peoples @- Who else here thinks we should use the Single Transferable Vote as our electoral system ?

For those of you who do n't know what it is , I think STV is the main truly proportional system of electing MPs .

Candidates are numbered similar to AV , but constituencies are multi @-@ member so seats are allocated based on numbers of votes .

I was sympathetic to STV , but then it seems that in the recent Irish elections it 's just as vulnerable to disproportionalities as FPTP...

The answer , a well trained and heavily equipped military , which although short on numbers at the moment , could easily be bolstered in a very short period of time .

The Libyan rebels are crying out for assistance in overthrowing Gadaffi , so I say we make them an offer .

We 'll send an army of 100,000 troops to take Tripoli , and in return they will provide us with a promise of a fee - say , 30 % of all Libyan oil revenue for the next 15 years .

So not only will the invasion create British jobs , take people off the streets , provide invaluable battle @-@ field experience and be self @-@ financing....it could actually be PROFIT MAKING !

BP and such British companies are already in Libya and have been for years .

Drastic action like you suggest will just form a beacon for all extremeists in Africa to come to Libya to kill British citizens

100,000 troops There 's barely that many soldiers and officers in the entire army , most of whom are not frontline but rather logistics , intelligence , engineering personnel and so forth .

You 'd have to start giving sailors and aircrew rifles and combat gear .

We are doing enough as it is in Libya , anything further we can do must be humanitarian ( supplying medical and food supplies to Misrata , for example ) or logistical ( supplying training and weapons to the rebels in Ajdabiya so they stop sucking )

OP I think you underestimate how long it would take to train and equip 100,000 soldiers then all the logistics and other such things that an army would need .

I 'm not insulting politicians here ; I 'm defending them for once .

Take the TV debates for example : everyone hated Dave 's " down with the people " and " I met a black man the other day..." act , but at the same time , had he remained aloof and failed to engage with anyone , he would have aggravated another group of people , and been called a toff even more .

Another example is that recent departure lounge picture , which everyone decried as a fake .

Again , it 's a lose lose situation : some say it was staged publicity , which is bad ; others say it was genuine , but the whole holiday was a pathetic attempt to pretend that " we 're all in it together "; others still would doubtless complain if Dave flew off first class to a five star resort instead of using Ryanair to go to some four star place in Spain ( or wherever it was ) .

Sometimes I find satire a bit annoying , because it means that politicians can never seem to do anything right .

I wish people would keep the debate on policies and ability @/@ desire to deliver them , not who 's a toff or who 's flying which airline or holidaying in which place , or using certain mannerisms to respond to questions .

Yep , I feel extremely sympathetic to politicans .

They get held to a higher standard than almost anyone else , seem loathed for doing a very , very tough job and often for doing what people claim they want them to do...

Well , you know , I doubt whether some of these " hard working " politicians would last very long if they had to work on a building site carrying bricks or steel gurders for 10 hours a day , or even work a 9 @-@ 5 carrying heavy frozen meat produce from one cage to another 7 days a week .

I hope to God the AV referendum returns a big fat NO so that this horrid left wing coalition can be returned to the dust and we can finally get on with real , Tory leadership ( thanks to First Past The Post , of course ) .

The problem for the Tories is n't the electoral system its that they do n't have enough widespread support in the electorate .

We had first past the post last time , the country was on its knees and we had had 13 years of Labour government , with Labour 's popularity at rock bottom .

But still the Tories did n't have enough support to get a majority under FPTP .

The Lib Dem vote will collapse but I bet more of their vote goes to Labour @/@ Greens than it does the Tories .

I think the UK was a broadly Tory nation up till the 1990 s but since then it has turned against them , they had their lowest ever days in the mid @-@ late 1990 s and early 2000 s , even since they 've had an upturn on the back of a Labour government running into problems , they 've not been able to build a broad base of support in the country like MacMillan or Thatcher did .

Labour got a majority in 2005 with 9.6 million votes but the tories come short in 2010 despite having 1.1 million more votes than this .

Some analyst reckon the tories needed just another 15,000 votes to get that majority .

I would have voted based on what I thought was best for the country .

If I honestly thought Labour could solve the problem , despite all my problems with them , I would have voted Labour .

But a lot of Labour voters I know/ have met , have told me that they vote Labour because ' Tories only care about the rich '.

And that is it , you ask them why they think that and....nothing .

Or another common reason ' Tories will take away EMA and give the moeny to the rich '.

Well yes , they took away EMA , but EMA was a stupid system anyway , unfair and put in place by the Labour government to try and make unemployment figures look better .

Most Labour voters I know in real life voted for them either out of ignorance and views inherited from their parents/peers .

Or because they wanted their pocket directly lined .

Now , I know this is n't the case for all Labour voters , hell there are some intelligent ones on TSR , who vote for Labour for decent reasons , and though I disagree I respect them for that .

I just feel that Labour get a lot of votes from the reverse @-@ snob working class in areas like mine .

So they can quite literally do anything , and people will still vote for them over the Tories .

I 'm fairly right wing , but I do n't think a full on tory government is what anyone wants .

This is a centrist country and the government should reflect that .

I 'd like it if we elected very socially liberal governments all the time ( to the point of legalising and taxing all narcotics ) , but I know that won't happen .

I 'd like withdrawl from the EU , but that won't happen .

Their policy of contractionary fiscal policy creates a substantial risk of the UK slipping back into recession , which means consumer confidence will begin to fall even further , as people will be more likely to save , which leads to less money being pumped into the economy , ie . a fall in aggregate demand .

With current levels of unemployment very high , job losses will be the consequence of these harsh , unnecessary cuts through the Coalition Government 's contractionary fiscal policy .

If we carry on with the current rate of cuts , we will reverse to the 1980 's , making the poorest poorer , and the richest richer , same old Tories !

Definately pro @-@ cuts , even though the wife lost her job , she still agrees with the cuts , it 's for the good of the country as a whole

I 'm just against the reforms that are going to cost as much to implement as they save and are done for ideological rather than financial reasons .

It makes me cringe that the government are cutting funding for the British people , and yet somehow fund the military to rain clusters of bombs over foreign people !

this country literally has no money and is in huge amounts of debt

I 'm against the increase in Uni fees though , on the whole I do realise that University fees DO have to increase , but trebling them within the space of a year is far too much

I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread , but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter .

I 'm a British Pakistani , born and brought up in London , however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .

Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan ' Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan ', made a few years ago , yet a very interesting watch .

I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times , and have traveled throughout the country , so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .

However , after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked .

I may be wrong when I say this , but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state , yet only 64 years on and I do n't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with .

It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture , in a sense it boosts their superiority complex .

I actually find it shocking , that most families who moved to England in the 60 's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan .

Also whilst I 'm on this topic , has anyone seen the film ' Slackistan ' and what were your views ?

While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled , ever since the fall of the wall in 1989 , Liberal democratic values have spread ( End of History , Fukuyama , 1992 ) and that does not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law .

Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire ( as long as it does n't harm anybody else ) .

I think it is the right direction that Western culture ( unforced ) is spreading , it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact , promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life .

Pakistan was founded on the basis that Muslims felt their interests would not be guarded by a Hindu government , not as some spiritual Muslim homeland .

As it is , I 'd hardly say Pakistan is ' Western ', what with it 's blasphemy laws , it 's constant conflict with India , conservative populace , tacit funding and support for various Islamist organisations .

I think rather than worrying about the populace , worry about yourself .

Who are you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch Western TV ?

Also , as you bemoan the West . It 's worth remembering you would n't have had a country without us

They are merely retaliating to whatever our politicians throw at them !

" If Iran changes course , abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions , and lives up to its international obligations , it will be welcomed back into the community of nations."...

As a weak country with no big weapons to defend its people..

All the huge countries that are bullying Iran into submission right now with sanctions and what not have nuclear weapons ?

Hey Israel , how about you assassinate some more Iranian scientists ?

they have a bad history of blowing things @/@ people they dont like up...

negs , quaint... are you all disputing irans known history of terrorism or are you all morons ?

This was n't done properly before going to war in Iraq and we had people opposed to it from the start , also going in with mixed messages ' its about WMD and a bit about regime change ' looked bad when there were n't any WMD there .

So we need to go in from the start saying with Iran it 's about regime change , Ahmedinijad is bad , he does n't respect womens rights or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapons and then go to war and do n't find any nuclear weapons .

I can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation is bad and any of these states having nuclear weapons is not desirable as it just leads to proliferation in the region , but that argument should have been used against Pakistan and Israel getting nukes .

Remember when we went in to take out Bin Laden we could n't tell the Pakistani government for fear that Bin Laden would have been tipped off and escaped...

The problem with these ' resolutions ' targeting Iran is that everyone can see the hypocrisy , its a case of our allies can have nukes but others can n't .

A much better resolution would have been a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region , which meant India and Pakistan had to disarm and Israel had to disarm , and any moves by any country in the region towards getting nuclear weapons would be met by international air strikes .

Are you a non @-@ Arab minority living in the Middle @-@ East , or do you know someone who did ?

Do you feel that the problem of racism is a big or a small one in comparison to places like America ( the southern states in particular )?

It 's not so much racist , as it is ' classist '.

They do n't abuse you because you 're a certain skin color , they abuse you because they think you 're some servant that barely makes any money and should be grateful for being there .

If you are from Pakistan , India , Bangladesh or any country that is n't very rich then you are mostly treated like crap .

However , if you are British , or from the US or any other rich European country then they treat you really well .

Indians in particular are treated badly , there are Indian maids and they are often hit by the house wife if they for example make a small mistake or sometimes they are hit with no reason .

I have relatives who live in one of those rich middle eastern countries and as far as I know they told me that some of them whilst at School have experienced racisms from children for example one of them a girl was called black and ugly and that her hair is bad but the teachers do n't do anything about it , they are racist themselves .

I have to admit I am really quite worried about Russia..

In the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenarios mainly centre around Iran and China , obviously both of those are grossly misrepresented , the idea of a US @-@ Chinese war for example is objectively absurd and no serious commentators pay it any attention , it 's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video games .

The situation in Iran has the ability to cause a lot of misery in the middle east but again , Iranian leaders are really quite self aware , they know what they are doing , and there is near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapons of them actually using them , although we as simple peasants obviously need to believe that and go along with our governments because if Iran does become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can n't be tolerated .

And just like Germany there is a hard turn to the far right by the country 's middle classes and the rise of egomaniacal leaders who are already undermining what little democracy there has been in Russia .

You have the ultra nationalist and deeply racist cossack tribes , highly militant , extremely aggressive and becoming more and more mobilised , convinced that the time has come for mother Russia and that x , y and z ethnic/religion/political groups are responsible for the loss of Russia 's glory and therefore must be eliminated .

Just like Germany was , Russia still is a major military power , a nuclear one , and with enormous economic potential .

Honestly when you think about it it really does look just.. terrifying .

Can anyone explain further or recommend some reading ?

Yes , Russia does have huge problems with neo @-@ nazi ideology ( which is kind of ironic given the history of Russia ) .

Russia regularly interferes in it 's neighbours ( such as the Ukraine and the invasion of Georgia when it became too western ) , but I do n't think it has much power beyond that , that is n't to say that they would n't if they could .

There is a lot of bitterness about how ex @-@ USSR states have become part of ' The West ' ( like Poland and Estonia for example ) .

I mean they helped the invasion of Afghanistan and Putin asked to join NATO .

Their closest " Western " allies are France and Italy ( and they are close ) .

It has terrible future demographics ( with no available fix through immigration ) and is totally dependent on exporting oil and gas - as well as being run by corrupt oligarchs ( who make Western corporatism look non @-@ corrupt and benevolent ) .

I think Russia is pretty neutral about most international affairs now , so I do n't see the big worry .

The Russian government is pretty bad , but their opposition is worse .

The leader of the second largest party in Russia , the communist party , wants Russia to be " re @-@ Stalinised ".

First off , a disclaimer of sorts , these are my opinions based on news reports and a little research around the topic so I apologise if my facts are wrong or inaccurate .

Like the title says I welcome thoughts either on my opinion , or on the matter in question .

Specifically Iran and its attempt at a nuclear program , where Iran hopes to gain nuclear power for peaceful purposes ( Iran 's statement ) .

The US and EU however believe that Iran are using this nuclear program to develop and obtain nuclear weapons claiming they have " information suggesting Iran had carried out tests relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device ".

Due to this the US and EU have imposed sanctions on Iran involving limits on the oil bought from Iran which in turn decreases their economy and other sanctions of similar consequences .

Right now that that 's done I can state my opinion , please correct anything I have put that is wrong !

My opinion in short is this , the US and EU have no right to impose sanctions on Iran and to deter their nuclear program .

HOWEVER , I am very opposed to Iran gaining nuclear weapons and threatening WW3 and in fact I am opposed to any country having nuclear weapons .

The only argument the US and EU have is that Iran is not a stable country at the moment and a unstable country should n't be able to kill millions at the touch of a button .

However for them to tell another country what they can n't have , when they have nuclear weapons themselves is nothing except hypocrisy .

From Iran 's point of view , one could argue that our governments are unstable with new leaders every 4 years with differing opinions and views .

What right do we have to dictate what another country can and cannot do .

I think that 's the essence of my argument , and I accept that the " Iran instability " is a big part of the sanctions .

Thank you for reading and I hope I 'm not completely ignorant here !

Why do countries not have a right to tell others what to do ?

People tell each other what to do all day every day , why should countries be exempt ?

Of course , Iran has every right to say " no ", but then those other countries have every right to refuse to trade with them .

Though I do n't believe we should have nuclear weapons either - it 's not hypocritical as such .

Most countries who have nuclear weapons now can be trusted not to abuse them - Iran cannot .

Regardless , I personally do n't think world security should be held back just because someone is worried about being a bit hypocritical .

I believe that the only reason why American gun sights have been trained on Iran is because of their decision to switch from petro @-@ dollars ( American ) to the gold standard or something similar .

This would would have a detrimental effect on the American economy , or practically any economy that relies on the dollar as a currency and as a result , the already weak American economy would lose it 's leading place .

This was demonstrated time and time again when Saddam switched to Euros in 2000 and Gaddafi wanted to switch to the gold standard before he was toppled .

The EU also wanted something similar and I do n't know what happened to that .

The hypocrisy argument gets nowhere , but most fail to understand the double standards suggest an ulterior motive , at the least a lack in credibility of the West .

Israel has illegally obtained and continues to have a nuclear arsenal , not to mention the innumerable UN violations against it 's neighbours , yet it is metaphorically Scot free to do as it pleases .

It 's like they are playing Poker : The Political leadership of Israel / US and Iran seem to me more likely to " go all in " rather than back down and fold or negotiate .

Iran is having a decent time trading with the East , and trying to stick two fingers up to the West .

Neither side want 's to jepordise their economic security by engaging in what will be a costly and deadly military action .

I think the only problems will come if and when Iran stop allowing Nuclear inspections , or when the UN/NATO/the West decide that there is a high probability that Iran are near realisation of weaponised nulcear material .

I personally find Russia 's behaviour at the UN this week to be absolutely disgusting .

Apparently they 're threatening to veto a resolution on Syria if it does not explicitly rule out foreign military intervention .

The text has already been ' watered down ' to omit the demand that Assad step down , yet again to appease the Kremlin .

Where 's the public outcry about Russian veto and unilateralism ( a criticism routinely employed - rightly - against the United States when it vetoes resolutions on Israeli aggression )?

So many have been killed that the UN has given up trying to count casualties , and yet we have a clique of barbarians and mafia crooks in Moscow holding the world hostage over this issue .

Russia is renovating a military base in Syria , has arms deals worth billions , infrastructure and energy deals .

Russian oil , gas and steel companies have substantial interests in Syria including an Arab gas pipeline , gas processing plant , deal with national syrian oil company and oil exploration there .

Russia wants stability and a friendly regime to ensure the security of their interests , so they back Assad .

Nevertheless , Assad would be lucky if he survived this year .

If you wish to understand Russia 's reasoning , know its national interest .

No way are they going to let that go down the drain if they can do something about it .

Nor are they willing to lose face by openly supporting the Syrian regime .

They will just exercise their UN privileges and keep sneaking the promised weapons into Syria one way or the other and keep cashing in on the opportunity .

Personally , I do n't think they would start WW3 if Iran is attacked , because they have more to lose , and they 'd probably just do things like supply weapons etc...

If WW3 does break out , we know we can go to Greenland or Egypt

whilst i think the prospect of ww3 is a slight bit of over kill the chinese do have a point in that the west is in no position to meddle in iranian affairs least of all at this stage

China yeh just u no how u like killin your own peeps just like I do ?

China lets like hang out together n attack ppl who try to stop us killin our peeps

Anyone , watching any of the GOP republican presidential debates , as you can see the media pathetic effort for pretending that Ron Paul does n't exist .

Ron Paul is right on every level but the mainstream media does not want him to get as much talk time as other Puppets such as Rick Santo rum and Mitt Romney

He is amazing , the only person who can take the USA forward .

However , he appears to be losing steam as a result of the timing of Florida and S. Carolina .

Do you realise that Ron Paul would disapprove of the video in your sig vehemently ?

Probably , but then due to the fact it 's got more space , the USA does n't have the same problem with Muslims as Europe does .

The U.S. has n't the capacity to commit to a full @-@ scale war with Iran at present if one keeps in mind its quite significant pre @-@ existing commitments , the state of the economy , and the strength of Iran 's defensive capability - targeted strike( s ) seems more likely , or perhaps greater action by Israel , but I doubt that .

Why is the United Kingdom allowing Asma Assad and her three children to remain in the UK ?

I know she was born and raised in London , but do you think that the UK is as anti @-@ Assad as it claims ?

One word , three letters , two vowels , one consonant .

We 've been hearing a lot in the news about Iran and its threats to shut the Straight of Hormuz , and how western countries ( e.g . the UK , the USA and France ) , but how are the countries around the straight reacting to the threat ?

as I cant seem to find anything on how countries such as Oman , Iraq the UAE are reacting .

It 's not a threat , it 's a response to the threats of others , e.g " Attack us and we 'll close the Strait of Hormuz ".

Unfortunately most TSR'rs are too brainwashed to see that .

IF they fall due to the surrounding countries going against them , then they 'll continue remaining sheeps and it won't be long till they 're toppled themselves .

I support Saudi 's arming up though , as I do for all Muslim nations , weapons may be useful in future .

Israel sold almost one billion $ of arms to the Islamic Republic during the Iran @-@ Iraq war and provided loads of military aid ( this was while Israel was apparently a supposed sworn enemy ) , training and even helpfully removed Iraq 's nuclear capacity in Operation Opera ; where if Saddam had developed nuclear weaponry he would have undoubtedly used against Iran .

Did you know that there was a camp just outside Tehran of Israeli tacticians aiding Khomeini and co against Iraq for the whole of the conflict with Iraq ?

The Islamic Republic owes an awful lot to Israel - it enabled it to survive against Saddam and continue the war with Iraq ( by continuing the war this enabled it to solidify it 's position by killing thousands and thousands of Iranian democrats and other members of the opposition - as well as terrorising the population ) .

Do n't forget that Iran supported America when they invaded Afghanistan and Iraq as well .

Sorry to inform you : THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE WOULD GO TO WAR :P

As nice as it would be for countries like the USA and the UK to be over there to help , the truth is we would n't interfere if it was n't for the oil and other economic and political gains .

If they do restrict the Straight it will will cause a massive decrease in the amount of oil to the west ( 40 % of imported oil comes from the straight according to a figure I saw on the news ) , and our economy would greatly suffer...

I highly doubt there would be a WW3 , but I do know for certain that the big countries and supper powers would go to war due to globalisation and economic links .

In Australia the poor quality of local broadcaster 's international news seems to have completely baffled the general population as to exactly what is going on , the coverage is utterly appealing to be honest and regularly confuses their nuclear programs and their attempts to blockade the Straits of Homuz .

Politically the general gist of things is that the current Labor government is stuck between sucking up to the United States and therefore getting embroiled in any potential conflict ( HMAS Parramatta is presently off Somalia under NATO command and could get drafted in should military action commence ) and the fact that the Greens now have control over them through their control of the Senate and their single lower house seat ( Hung Parliaments for you ) and of course are very anti @-@ war , anti @-@ NATO and anti @-@ ANZUS .

The ultimate result will be down to who is Prime Minister when such a situation occurs , according to the unions they intend to fire Gillard next month and replace her with Kevin Rudd yet again who is extremely pro @-@ China and less aligned with the United States although he will probably suck up to Obama as well .

The opposition will attempt to counter any potential for entering the war with statements such as " They 'll be Iranian Boatpeople " causing national panic and further hatred of innocent refugees potentially leading to an early election and a Coalition ( Liberal @-@ Nationals ) government being formed who will support the war to a degree but otherwise will be to focused on Nauru which is the main aim of their entire foreign policy .

Throughout history , the expelling of Diplomats has usually meant one thing and when this is coupled with the Arab Spring alongside general unrest for a long period in Iran , it seems inevitable we are heading towards another war .

As a general question , I would like to ask others to see what you think ?

Are we going to war , what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinions on another war in the Middle East .

P.S. Just to clarify I am neither anti nor pro war , this is just a launch pad for a discussion .

Given the Israeli mentality I would say we will see them strike Iran .

it would quite an amazing escalation if Israel used nuclear bombs on Iran .

I know , however Israel is going to know that if they strike Iran Iran will hit back .

The idea of a single debilitating strike on Iran that will stop it ever being able to strike back is going to be very very tempting for Israel .

And depending on which way the American election goes American support may not be forthcoming if someone like Ron Paul gets elected

If they have @/@ get nukes , no one 's invading Iran .

I personally think it would be cool , Israel might have to think twice before carrying out major bombings in Palastine etc.

Of course not but the question is fast becoming not will Israel strike but when and how .

bit of a novice at economics but i was wondering , after kim jong @-@ il 's death why are the stock markets in asia @/@ korea falling ;

This will hopefully herald the end of socialism as we know it as people will realise that it is doomed to fail .

Romney probably has a better chance than Gingrich of beating Obama .

I personally would like to see Ron Paul be the nominee , but Backmouth probably has better chance of becoming a TSR Mod than this happening .

It is a shame that scandal has hit Herman Cain because he had promise .

I am an Independent voter and my opinion is that who ever the Republican nominee is , they probably won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the U.S. economy if elected .

If Obama is reelected he definitely won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the economy .

The US are making moves encouraging a very likely chance of war !

The UK does not have the means to carry out an attack on Iran . -

Forget the fact that the US/UK/NATO would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack .

Israel ? They can do what they want .

Was the war involving the IRA and INLA a success or a failure ?

And what are your views on those trying to establish a socialist republic in Ireland ( not the Guerilla Army 's )?

I do n't think many people really understand why you insist on murdering each other either .

Ireland needs to overcome its grip of alcohol .

The law of return gives Jewish people and those who half Jewish on their mother 's side the right to become Israeli citizens .

Britain is now refusing to give aid to countries who discriminate against gays , we must now do the same to sexist and racist nations .

Israel must set an example to these less developed nation by scraping this outrageous policy .

What if the government said all people of European heritage are free to become British citizens would we call them racist ?

Created for the Jewish people , does n't seem that odd that if you 're Jewish you 're allowed citizenship .

Judaism is passed through the mother ( a Jewish mother makes you a full blooded Jew , not half jewish ) that 's how Judaims works .

And as soon as you 're a citizen if you 're under 40 ( 35 for women ) you will have to join the IDF .

I just do n't think it 's that shocking or appalling .

Also , they have a very good refugee policy - they 'll take pretty much anyone who is fleeing for safety .

Countries are free to make up Immigration rules as they please .

For example if my Grandfather was a British Citizen born in the U.K , who then moved and married a none British Citizen , and they then had my mother outside of the U.k , my mother would still be eligible for citizenship .

However if my mother then married a non Brit and gave birth to me outside of U.K I would no longer be eligible for citizenship as Citizenship rights only extend one generation in the Uk .

However if it were Ireland instead of the U.k I would still be eligible for Citizenship if my Grandfather was Irish .

So I would be Irish if my Grandfather was Irish , but I would not be British if my Grandfather was British .

but immigration laws by their very nature are discriminatory , that is their whole purpose , to discriminate who is and who is n't allowed into a country .

All nations have them and they all tend to be different ( which is normal considering different nations have different cultures , traditions and customs ) , it just so happens that in Israel the requirement is that your mother is @/@ was Jewish , it is different to requirments in other countries but it is no less valid .

Reading the newspaper today you may have seen an article regarding a teenager called Tariq Aziz .

He was part of a scheme organised to document the effect of drone strikes , he was given a camera .

On his way to his aunts house he and his 12 year old cousin were slaughtered by an illegal cia drone strike .

No @-@ one cos its America , and they are clearly above the law because they have money .

How the **** can America complain about Palestinian home @-@ made rockets when they 're using drones without a care in teh world ?

Why does America have the right to ****ing attack anywhere its want without any accountability ?

Why when they kill civillians do they have the cheek , to quote the Times article to say ' they 're has been no collateral damage in drone attacks ' when according to the Times again there are pictures of incinerated young children ?

At least most muslims are sane , unlike the American goverment who just can n't seem to stop committing terrorist acts .

I 'm sorry for the swearing , i 'm not one to usually swear , but the CIA et al are a joke .

If Iran sent a little drone to America and did the samething , what would the ramifcations be ?

OP I suggest that you watch the documentary ''Secret Pakistan'' on BBC iPlayer and then come back to argue .

This supposed ally of the USA is training and preparing INNOCENT Afghan children who are too young to understand Islam properly to go into a busy Afghan bazaar to blow up INNOCENT Afghan civilians .

This is what Pakistan deserves for funding lunatic Islamic rebels since the the 1960 s against any Afghan government that has existed .

The truth is , every time these drones hit , they kill maybe 10 % terrorists ( at max ) and 90 % civilians .

Each of this civilians is a real human with real emotion , not just a statistic .

For instance , a 10 year old kid sees their father blown to pieces , you expect them to love the Americans ?

They become radicalised and ready to murder Americans at any cost .

America strategically targets civilians so they have a reason to stay there due to further radicalisation of youth .

I tried to watch the program " Secret Pakistan " but the question i kept asking was why ?

In the first ten - twenty minutes they never explained why Pakistan would want to double cross .

The president is corrupt and money hungry but i would say that there are plenty of easier ways for him to do that if he so pleases and putting the country into turmoil and him in a terrible light would surely be foolish .

And re the whole drone thingn I really struggle to understand how they can be justified at all .

When lots of people in USA died in 2001 they felt angry , agrieved and wwant revenge .

To do this they went on a long war resulting in thousands of deaths and also did not take regard for countries ' sovereignty .

Now again a lot if not the majority of deaths are not caused by the USA directly but a significantly large number are therefore it is still a valid point to raise .

I would love to know how a usa citizen would react if bombs were dropped on their home towns by a foreign country .

I 'm sure they would be happy to forget it and want no justice .

Well , we would n't be doing anytyhing were it not for the terrorists in the first place .

So instead of going to a parliment meeting , they went to armory and decided to blow **** up and kill innocents .

I think most people are looking at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .

Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan , can anyone give me a successful attack by al @-@ Qaeda on the West since the intervention ?

Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians , quite the contrary .

Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area .

Interestingly , the number of terror attacks in Pakistan dropped which can prove to be conclusive evidence of the effect on al @-@ Qaeda and Taliban leadership and their effective operational capability that is decreasing .

One can logically say these drone attacks are working , which is reported on both sides if you look at the current fragmentation of al @-@ Qaeda and asscoatied jihadist sects leadership operating on the Afghan @-@ Pakistani border .

These missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance , including the use of small , unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets .

Ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , Bloomberg reports that 1,300 militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid @-@ 2008 .

On the grounds of legality , according to the Geneva Convention , members of regular armed forces - involved in conflicts - are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force .

The operators in Pakistan are the United States ( USAF ) and the Pakistani military .

Yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .

Of course this is not how we work , but then you can n't start saying we 're undemocratic because people do n't turn out for the vote , that is their problem , not the governments .

It is democratic because together they recieved more votes than Labour , so they have a right to power .

Right , so to you there 's no difference in blowing up 100 's of civilians in a crowded market place , and blowing up a building but phoning the threat in beforehand to minimise civilian casualties ? In that case , it 's ok every , Bishy just basically said collaterol damage does n't exist for any Western forces as there 's no distinction between force used . Let 's start bombing civilian areas , it just does n't matter apparantly And of course , I do n't condone either group , afterall , the IRA 's aims were only achieved after they laid down their arms .

This is why we need a republican government to try and decrease our ridiculous government spending .

Republicans do nothing but spend money , and fight wars --- and encourage wars --- and spend more money trying to put americans in a constant state of fear .

Apparently 44 % of Americas budget is spent on Medicare @/@ Medicaid and Social Security which is a joke considering how naff American welfare is

Suppose you got a letter that stated you must attend a month of military training before you are sent to Iran/Zimbabwe/Syria to protect the civilians from oppression .

Do you go or do you sacrifice your dignity ?

Not going would in no way sacrifice your dignity .

What if you have three children to feed ?

How would making the choice not to leave them alone and destitute mean you surrender your dignity .

In answer to the more general question you are trying to pose : no , I would n't .

Anybody who does such work deserves all of our respect ( assuming no ulterior motive ) but it is n't for everyone , and that does n't make somebody a bad person .

I would protect my family and friends , I have no interest in personally protecting strangers...

i 'm not here to save the world , in no way does that decision impact my dignity

In 1951 Libya was the poorest country in the world , before the nato intervention Libyans enjoyed the highest standard of living in Africa .

Newly married couples receive $ 50,000 to buy their own home and electricity is free for all .

Gaddafi vowed to house every Libyan before his own parents , he kept his promise and his own father died before he was able to be housed .

Now education is free and high quality .

If libyans cannot find the education or healthcare they need in Libya the government unds them to go abroad to access it .

Any Libyan wishing to become a farmer is given free use of land , a home , equipment , livestock and seeds .

On July 1 sr 2011 , 1.7million people assembled in Green Square , Tripoli to show defiance against the Nato bombing of Libya .

The Libyan central bank is state owned and unlike banks in the west is now owned by the elite or ridden by debt .

search youtube , theres plenty of videos of him beign driven around waving and shaking hands of the dozens of people running after him .

The second he started giving out oil contracts to Russia @/@ Asia he was ousted .

1. He started a war in Chad - a crushingly poor nation that was in the middle of a civil war at the time - with the intent of establishing a puppet Jamahiriya that he could control .

Thankfully he failed after Chad , with the assistance of France , expelled his forces .

2. He started this war in Chad by luring immigrants from Pakistan and poor Sahelian nations to Libya with the promise of civilian work , and then press @-@ ganging them into fighting as the Islamic Legion .

Many legionnaires are still a major threat to peace and stability in Central Africa today , specifically in Darfur where they are now known as the Janjaweed .

3. He directly funded terrorism against the United Kingdom in the form of the IRA , which he also trained and equipped , and sponsored other acts of international terrorism such as the Lockerbie bombing .

4. He embezzled billions of dollars of public money to fund a lavish , dictatorial lifestyle for him and his family .

6. Any political dissent within Libya was brutally repressed by the Khamis Brigade , directly lead by Khamis Gaddafi - one of his sons , and composed of foreign mercenaries willing to do anything against the Libyan people for their next payslip .

I think he did that to keep his people happy so that people would be less likely to oppose him or he started out good genuinely wanting to help his people but became obsessed with power .

How can a country like the USA , relatively liberal and tolerant , have such a powerful party of extremists ?

Britain has nothing to match the Republican Party , on social issues , apart from perhaps the BNP - but even they do n't hate on gays as much as the Republican Party does .

In 2011 , how can Americans even think of voting in such a party ?

It 's an incredibly religious country @- and a very evangelical one at that .

As much as I hate their attitude , you need to understand that it 's just the way they 've been brought up to think

The people who get involved in politics to the degree of going to debates are , thankfully , not representative of the majority of people over there .

It 's known that the USA is n't as progressive as Western Europe with regards to gay rights and attitudes towards gay people .

He said that sex has no place in the military and orientation is irrelevant , which I agree with .

But then he said he 'd bring DADT back , which is disagree with .

If a gay soldier is better than , or just as good as a straight soldier , then it makes no difference what their sexuality is .

At the end of the day , if I was serving on the front line with other troops , I 'd want the best troops , not the straightest .

The USA has legalised gay marriage in some states , and federal equality laws . Sure , some people are n't up with that - but that 's freedom for you .

Contrast this with the wonders of the Palestinan Authority , where it is a criminal offence to be gay and punishable by imprisonment .

You hear a lot of criticism of Israel - but if you had to , would you rather live there or one of its closest neighbours ? Bearing in mind Israel 's freedoms , prosperity , etc.

Note : I know some of the countries do n't physically neighbour Israel , but they are extremely close so they count .

Eygpt , probably because they 're comparitively level and calm . ( I said comparatively ) .

I know a LOT of Lebanese people and let me tell you , they 're the most fun loving persons I have ever met .

It looks really beautiful too !

Israel because its the least likely country to get bombed and invaded by Israel

Its future is very uncertain and Christians ( assuming some of you are ) are routinely not treated properly .

I really have no idea why -- unless you were a devout Muslim -- you would choose Saudi Arabia over Israel .

Unless you have no care for any of your freedoms .

And before anyone makes any sarcy comments about Israel , at least a woman can drive there..

None , when I was in Cyprus the heat was too annoying , so I 'd rather not reside in that region .

Its only a little swim away i 'd call it a neighbor , lived there for 2 years , lovely , go for a swim in the sea catch some rays on the saturday , then off to build a snowman on Troodos on the sunday , great little island .

I saw the news story about the submariner who went on a killing spree on a nuclear submarine and it worried me quite a bit .

Nuclear weapons have kept the worlds superpowers from wiping each other out

The Submarine was just powered by a Nuclear Reactor , it fires non nuclear warheads .

We have every reason to hope that does n't happen , tbh .

Why would governments and companies in certain countries sell arms to an offensive country when they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country when it attacks a country they do like

I am talking about the Iraq before and during the Gulf War .

Iraq attacked Iran then governments were happy to sell weapons to Iraq including UK , France , US , West Germany , Italy , China and Soviet Union .

A small minority sold only to Iran these were North Korea and surprizingly Israel according to Israel ( although Iran denies this ) .

Why would all these countries be happy for Iraq to go on the war path and to fund both all sides of the war yet go after Iraq when it starts on Kuwait ( although they left Saddam in power ) .

My thoughts are that governments simply let their private arms companies make a bit of cash off the war like they usually do .

They used their puppet governments of the Shah and Saddam to control the countries to counter Soviet influence in the region .

When the Islamic revolution happened the US lost all their influence over the nation so after Iraq began their attempted invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence .

Then when they saw Saddam invading country they already had influence in Kuwait they finally took action although they left him in power as the Soviets were still there and would n't want Iraq to become communist .

Then 12 years later there is no longer a Soviet union but they notice a strengthening Iran that is a potential threat to their ally Israel so when some they get some ' evidence ' of Iraq with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via MI6 they jump with joy to invade it .

It is a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator Saddam or they stop Iraq getting nukes .

Then they build up their bases in Iraq and fund a new government to counter the threat of Iran as they lost all influence upon Iraq when they stopped them in the first gulf war .

These wars are just ways to prevent other nations gaining any sort of power whether it is directly or indirectly as well as make their arms companies some major money on the side .

So if you still think the US and co are the just and honourable governments they claim to be why would they allow companies to fund two sides of a war ?

why would they go to war over an ideology ?

Because governments change every 4 years in most places and every government tends to pursue a different policy .

Blair sold guns to Gaddafi and Cameron helped oust him , you can n't look at it as if Cameron is bound or responsible for the actions of Blair

A countries actions should n't ( and luckily don't ) depend on moral standards .

If only we could make the leaders look right into the eyes of every civilian they kill , maybe the fighting and wars would stop .

Obviously I know it never will , but I can dream .

There is so much discussion these days about race , muslims , etc that I get the feeling there are underlying problems .

Personally I feel sorry for them ( non whites and Muslims ) as they bear the brunt of these discussions .

''learn from history'' - yes , and it teaches us ''multiculturalism'' actually always fails .

I do however believe we could get along together , if we figured out how .

Douchebags like this being given a forum to air their views is fanning a lot of contagious stupidity

its funny , when muslims plants bombs , the first thing people say is , ' why did they do this ? ', well , fair enough , because its better to understand motives , the same applies to the growth of nationalism in europe .

many factors are at play , anti white racism , immigrant crime which targets white people disproportionally , mass invasion immigration policy , abuse of immigration and welfare systems .

it is no use just blaming ' racism ' as it misses the issues .

I 'm as right @-@ wing as they come , but why are the British keeping hold of islands that are not theirs ?

I long for the day that the islands are reunited with Argentina and diplomatic relations between Britain and Argentina can resume .

When the Falkland Islanders decide they want to be Argentinian .

They are quite fond of being British right now .

As I understand it , the inhabitants of these islands feel a strong sense of Britishness , and want to continue to remain British .

The islands belong to the islanders , not argentina , and if the islanders say they want to be argentinian , or independent , then the islands would cease to be british .

Can you not understand the difference between an individual in one country wanting to be a citizen of another ( basically a wannabe migrant ) and a state wishing to retain its territorial status ?

In your American example , that 's the difference between a dude in Azerbaijan saying " I want to be American - why can n't I ? " and Hawaii saying " We want to remain part of the US ".

Although I do believe that if the majority of Islanders wish to be British we should keep the Islands .

I mean they in no way want to be part of the UK , but they 're right next to us , so they should be...

They already belong to the UK and the UK grants them local governance .

So technically they already belong to their owners .

The problem with this logic is there are more than enough people who think differently to cover the costs - and they ( or anyone in fact ) could n't care less what you think .

They will be paying for the defence themselves if with the oil revenue as well so there will be even less reason for you to complain in the future .

I have to write about the IMFs involvement in current affairs for school , i must have been living under a rock for the past few months because I have NO idea at all as to what the IMFs involvment with Greece is , ive tried to google it but all the different information is confusing me , can anyone explain please ?

They are called in when countries fail to run their economy properly .

Of course Eurocrats failed to see what was happening... what do you expect from hansomly @-@ paid , non @-@ audited people resposible for other @-@ people 's money ?

That 's only a percentage point higher than the UK , but unlike us they have double digit economic growth so have plenty of room to work with .

The rural areas accomodate many of the peasants in china and as it faced such high rises in food prices and a 6 % rise in general prices , those peasants are going to find it increasingly hard to purchase their commodities .

Does the theory hold weight or is it just a product of modern day Oriental @-@ ism ?

If you have JSTOR access and have n't read Ervand Abrahamian 's article on Huntington , then I recommend it .

It seems Australia is proposing a ban on the cultivation and possession of a range of plants that contain certain psychoactive substances .

- Datura ( the former and latter both common garden flowers , but are crap as recreational drugs due to their high toxicity . Idiots who try it once wont try it again , if they survive.)

- Any plant containing DMT ( this is the one i find most absured as there are litterally 100 s if not 1000 s of plants and trees that contain this substance , many grow wild in Australia and are commonly used in landscaping .

This is completely pointless legislation , bureaucracy at its finest , that is going to criminalise potentially millions of innocent people who work with these plants or grow them ornamentally in their gardens .

And just how do they expect to be able to enforce a ban on litterally thousands of species of plants ?

And then of course we come back to the old chesnut ; most of the substances in these proposed plants are less harmful and addictive than legal substances , such as alcohol and tobacco .

This article is a few months old , so i dont know if this made it into the law books or if it was thrown out , so if anyone has any information id like to hear about it .

It 's your responsibility to use drugs sensibly and your choice whether you abuse them or not .

It 's no right of the government or anyone to control what you consume .

I think the government should tackle drug use and damaged lives by providing support for those who need it , not by criminalising them .

Many drug addicts get send to prison and are given Methadone to ' ease ' their addictions to crack , meth or heroin .

it will cause damage now to those addicted but better for long term

It 's the illegality of drugs that makes the production , distribution and use of those drugs hugely expensive and harmful to everyone .

Most of the outlawed drugs , if taken with a bit of knowledge and awareness , are mostly as harmful , if not much less harmful , than tobacco or alcohol .

Herman Cain I would support any means to protect the country . Not liking the sound of that

The Fox News one seemed to be let down by the fact that so many of the undeclared big names were n't there ( for the obvious reason that they 're undeclared ) .

Notwithstanding a few of his religious nutter @-@ esque social views Ron Paul is the only Republican who actually makes sensible points about big government and the only one I have any respect for .

I just saw a similar thread on SAudi arabia , so i thought , why not in Pakistan as well ?

I dont need to explain the situation there...... but shouldnt they have a revolution ?

The press is relatively free so people have a medium they can vent through .

There are too many factions that are fighting amongst each other - if they unite under a common cause then there would be a serious threat of revolution .

Secondly , Gaddafi is the autocrat of his country , if he wishes to stamp out rebellion , it 's his prerogative .

All states hold the right to defend their own interests .

The Falklands the first Gulf War and to an extent the second gulf war .

I see what your saying but if we have a chance to help people fight for democracy and not be brutally crushed then we should do something .

We rarely get the chance to support rebellions as in most cases the rebels are as bad as the government they are fighting .

Libya can be seen as a popular uprising against a Tyrant .

No doubt people complain but they would complain if we did nothing to .

No one wants to see another Rwanda and this event seems to signify a much more proactive Right foreign policy from the UK .

Well you are just going to have to wait until after this ends are n't you to see if it was .

Frankly I cannot imagine why companies would negotiate oil contracts only to try to convince the government to invade the country so they lose them .

Taking some of the responsibility for enforcing a no fly zone ( i.e . patrolling shooting down any planes which Gadaffi uses to bomb civilians ) would have been acceptable due to the UN resolution and the fact that civilians in Benghazi were sitting ducks .

I increasingly get the impression that the coalition are not protecting civilians ( i.e . unarmed citizens , not rebels ) but rather are passively supporting the rebellion by decimating Gadaffi 's soldiers who , at the end of the day , are just doing what they are told .

It 's easy to shout oil and the fact that it gets shouted so often means that it 's also brushed off by those supporting military action , without a thorough evaluation .

Oil is not the only reason why the coalition are backing the rebels ( and I 'm going to take the plunge now and say that they are ) , but it is certainly a consideration .

Gadaffi has stated that ( assuming he regains control over his country ) he will only sell oil to the Russians and the Chinese .

The rebels on the other hand have stated that they are willing to upgrade oil production in Benghazi three @-@ fold .

People can argue that we are doing our bit by helping out the Libyans in their time of crisis .

I do think our main reason for helping is oil and resources , which is pretty much as bad as doing nothing as we 're not setting the example of helping people out in a time of crisis , its more of a " we 'll help but only because we might get something in return "

Anybody who believes the British Empire , once again , intervened in yet another country on ' humanitarian grounds ' to protect ' innocent civilians ' is absolutely ignorant of history and cannot use mere logic , or at least does not apply it to ' Queen and Country '.

Or , they could be the opposite of independent thinkers and accept the propaganda spouted by the establishment .

If the rebels were Communists , the intervention lead by the United States , Britain and France in Libya would not have occurred , nor would the rebel opposition be supported , had they been Communists .

If this was not the case , the United States would be intervening exactly how they are today in Libya , even if the rebels had been the Taliban .

Furthermore , Britain and France have always stated from the very beginning that they were willing to intervene in Libya without the approval of the United Nations .

Yet the justification they keep using for this intervention is to ' enforce humanitarian law authorised by the United Nations '.

And when it does , all those who supported this intervention should be held accountable for their ignorance and the crime of strengthening a system which has consistently proven , through its billions of dead victims , to be the greatest monster this world has ever seen .

although it may not seem like it has nothing to do with religion , just politics...i feel like the world is coming to an end or something cause muslims are finally taking a stance for their rights....

this is probably a really stupid question but just give me some feedback about this matter

guys..i know its a bit tedious but im just wondering..

if you guys can be bother than dont bother reading it then !

They tend to be secular leaderless and made u mostly of the young .

What is wrong with Muslims speaking up for their rights ? ??

And as far as an Islamic revolution is concerned i would say that it depends on how organized religious or clerical organizations are in a country and how politicized they are .

It apeas Noth Korea has started enriching uranium at a brand new plant that apparently is very modern .

The only hope is if Dear Leader 's son allows change but do n't hold your breath .

Hey guys , Reading the news daily , I can n't help but notice that occasionally , the western media ( CNN and sometimes BBC ) pictures China as a country who is heartless , has no respect for human rights , dictatorship etc.etc .

However , this past summer , i went to China for holiday , and it was nothing like the western media pictured it to be , the people all seem to enjoy life , no signs of human rights abuses ( i traveled to Tibet to , the people seemed happy ) .

I can n't help but feel that the western media is portraying only one side of the story ( Tibet ) ,when in reality we Brits have also invaded Tibet and the world said nothing .

I see that we are afraid of a communist country rising , and i know they are n't the nicest people , but neither were we when we colonized 1 @/@ 4 of the world , or when the Americans drove the Indians off their land .

Are we right to be complaining about China when we do n't have a clean record either ?

I 'm half Chinese and the Western media is definitely demonizing China .

The Chinese government has more support from its people than the British government does .

When the West criticizes China about its lack of democracy of humans rights abuses it 's usually only the West who has a problem with it and not the average Chinese person .

The fact that they do n't care about Uyghurs just shows what hypocrites and bigots they are .

That 's because whenever a Chinese person does complain they get thrown in prison or shot .

although I do n't criticise it on democracy as democracy is always right or good .

The media demonoising china is just what the media does , it demonises everything its how they sell papers with horror stories .

Even if they get nukes iran are still heavily outmanned , outgunned and isolated .

Their UAV 's wont be as good as isreali and american UAV 's

Their missiles will barley cross their own borders before they are shot down by a multitude of defences the USA has ALREADY been preparing in the middle east for the past god knows how long .

The only thing the extremist muslims can possibly do is blow themselves up in our borders .

And they have failed that more than enough times .

Iran with nukes however will unify and strengthen the resolve and moral of the muslims

Iran wants to portray itself as the ' hero ' of the muslims against the western infidels by having nukes and defying the USA .

So lets ignore iran , they are like the kid in primary school with the attention seeking problem .

Meh Maybe if the came clean with their nuclear program and would accept help that the rest of the world is offering .

If they are so peaceful why not allow UN inspectors in .

The problem is n't that they could potentially outmatch us in terms of nuclear capability .

The problem is that its monstrous regime will become more stable , and will be able to dictate the rest of the world 's policy towards it .

Plus , one must consider the potential ramifications of thermonuclear weapons falling into the hands of a regime run by the clergy ; a clergy that has repeatedly laid claims to the island nation of Bahrain , supports Nasrallah 's thuggish militia in Lebanon , makes continual references to the apocolypse and the return of the ' twelfth imam ', and so on .

That 's without going into how it will make a complete mockery of international law and non @-@ proliferation .

Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II dies , Prime Minister Julia Gillard has said just days ahead of a general election .

Welsh @-@ born Ms Gillard said the Queen 's death would be an " appropriate point " for Australia to move away from having a British monarch as head of state .

Australians voted against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum , but the issue continues to be divisive .

It 's up to them if they wish to sever the bonds that unite their heritage , history , and present .

I do n't think the issue is that they have a hereditary monarch , but the fact that the hereditary monarch in question is a ' foreign ' one ( yes , I am aware she is Queen of Australia in her own right , but you know what I mean ) .

the monarchy exists here for the same reason it does over there .

It 's not a drain on their economy and their power and sovereignty is n't being controlled in real political terms .

I do , however , agree with the proposed flag change , if that 's what Australians want .

In the past nations would develop new technology to dominate its rivals , however with recent attempts to prevent Iran from developing Nuclear technology are we seeing powerful nations using economic terrorism ( sanctions ) and war to prevent other nations from developing technology to compete .

For a nation with civilian and military nuclear technology to essentially deny another nation the same right to develop technology it is clear that the old guard of westenr powers are trying to prevent emerging powers from developing the same level of technology .

How can Iran stake its claim to its right ?

The sanctions placed on Iran are designed to appear to target only military groups but with research you will see it massively targets civilian business , infrastructure and even the attempt of Iranian students to study outside of Iran .

Other developing nations would be wise to realise that western powers have a stake in preventing the development of nations they consider inferior particularly Asian , African and South American nations .

This realisation should make them realsie they must band together to defeat this racist threat .

I would suggest an economic block and the sharing of nuclear technology within this block to ensure their sovereignty from both military and economic war .

America has a vested interest in keeping certain nations poor and weak but with solidarity and strength these nations can rise up and defy this evil threat .

Hmm here is a country that generally does n't like me should I let them build a big nuclear weapon they can kill me with ?

Iran will get destroyed by the Israelis before it has a chance to get a nuclear weapon , and if Israel is unable to do so then the Israeli race would be ( excuse the pun ) exterminated .

Since the dawn of civilization countries and provinces have sort do out do each other and gain from others weakness .

You say it is crazy that america forces sanction on Iran , yet it is not in their economic or defence interests to allow this to happen so in fact it is perfectly sane .

If iran were to developed nuclear weapon , they would use them , and they would , theoretically , become the powerhouse in the middle east .

This is against US forgien policy for two reasons , firstly they need to secure the safty of the oil fields in the middle east , and secondaly an anti @-@ western superpower in the middle east will more likely that not attract the backing of China , who already have made it perfeclty clear that they are inforcing their dominance over Africa .

If ahmadinejad did say this , does he have any info as to what is gonna go down ?

Do you think the americans will strike other ME countries in the run up to the iran attack or simulataneously strike ?

Just hope we do n't get dragged into this war ; we can n't even deal with the taliban...

There 's nothing about it on the BBC , but yes , a strike is inevitable .

The United Kingdom will do exactly as the United States says because of this idiotic perception that both of our nations share a ' special relationship '.

The United Kingdom will be dragged into it , you can bet your bottom dollar on that .

[Edit] Ok since alot of people think the ' Tehran Times ' is untrustworthy I will give another source which gives the same information about Liam Fox 's statement .

I can n't bring myself to understand this in any way .

I remember seeing some pictures of deformities a little while back and could n't even believe it was humanly possible .

They disturbed for a few days after and that 's from someone who is n't easily upset .

Back then I always believed that the leaders of our militaries would never allow this .

They would never allow generations of Iraqi 's to suffer from mutations and deformities like these .

I passed it off as propaganda at the time but now the evidence seems substantial and clear that this is exactly what happened .

How can you explain to the children why they are born with paralysed limbs or are born with their eyes formed inside out ?

That 's ******* disgusting and I hope the perpertrators are made to suffer what generations of Iraqi 's already have and will ever endure .

Remember those who champion themselves on human rights are actually the biggest terrorists in the world .

certain places like fallujah , tikrit , mosul atc , baathi scum strongholds deserve it for what they did to Iraq and the Iraqi people under saddam 's( May God curse him ) regime .

That 's ******** for a start the US would not a shell a town with DU , it 's high density means it is used for penetrator core for armour piercing sabot rounds , to be used against tanks .

It 's a kinetic energy round and would serve no purpose other than in a pitched tank battle , of which there were n't that many in GW2 .

And that 's the Independent article , I do n't even need to bother trying to discredit something from the ' Tehran Times '.

Never liked it but when war happens you have to expect any atrocities .

They want to sue the UK and US ?

It is a ******* war we would be stupid to give them money because they will only use it for weaponry to fight against our armed forces and they will probably plant some DU in our country or even nuke us innocent civillians for payback .

Sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen , but you 'd be naive to think this is possible and this is how a war should be conducted .

Do n't tell me Muslim countries like Iran and pre @-@ war Iraq would n't invoke such methods if they could .

Apologies for being so inevitably stupid but...J Am I wrong in thinking superpowers are judged by their worth , their GDP ?

If so , how can China overtake the US even as it grows in this area ?

I know the US have a lot of debt , and a great deal of it is owed to China

when you have 1 billion+ people , its almost impossible not to become a super power...even if your army are fighting with swords and bows....cos it simply is n't possible to win against the sheer amount of numbers

I 'm just trying to find out more about the subject really..

its their industry , cheap labour , huge workforce , investment in technology and hard working nature .

China is investing in the future , we here in Britain really are not...

China is going for it headlong and because of this are developing more and more and discovering new things .

China also has less strict laws on what not to do...i.e they will test and fund things that we have regulations against .

Finally , they are a hard working people with dedication and less slobby

Compared to the others , China look like a bunch of savages : disgusting human and animal rights records and a lack of freedom .

Coupled with the fact that the country has just been through a huge reccesion that has wiped off more than 10 % of its GDP , and that it is falling to pieces through political instability , I think im right to say its a joke @- not to mention the fact that its entire economy is based around exporting natural resources that will soon run out .

Did you just refer to information from Wikipedia in your argument ?

They all share the same writing language though which I reckon distinguishes from most other languages .

China already is a super power ; US monetary policy is practically dictated by China .

If they wanted to crap all over the $ they could do it on a whim - no other country on the planet has the ability to do so , let alone devalued their currency to such an extent it makes their exports look ridiculously cheap .

However to be a super @-@ power you do n't strictly have to be a developed economy .

China is decades from being as developed as the US , regardless of the amount of money they have - Chinas greatest compromise is time .

Major cities are much closer to their Western counterparts , however it is beyond where the issue lie in Chinas push as a credible economic entity .

What... so because i referred to wikipedia somehow my argument is null and void ?

I got a few Chinese people telling me that China will be #1 in the future .

I bet Soviet Union had no idea they 'd be perished in the late 80 s @-@ early 90 s .

US wants to be the only example that represents democracy ( Iraq being replaced with democratic system , etc ) .

Because China is a communist country , it would be harder for them to influence other countries politically like how Great Britian influenced its idea to different regions of the world ( US in language , Hong Kong in legal structure and language , etc ) .

30 @-@ 40 years is a very long time , I 'm not denying that China has potential and could potentially become the most powerful country in the world .

Notice the world could in bold , some people would argue that if it continues this growth it would become the world 's most powerful country , both economically and militarily even I can see that , but the US will inevitably interfere , because it simply does n't want competition , it wants to remain being the biggest , baddest dude on the block , and with China arriving on the world stage( i.e the new kid on the block ) there 'll inevitably and undoubtably be confrontations .

I think China will become the world 's second largest economy - perhaps even the largest , I think China will become very strong militarily - perhaps not as strong as the US as it is light years behind , but still strong , perhaps even stronger than all of Europe combined without the use of nukes .

Meaning that its economy and military are both 10 times stronger than everyone elses - no I do n't , as I 've pointed out in my previous post , there 'll China will inevitably want to become the regional power of Asia , it 'll want to do some land @-@ grabbing of its own( Taiwan for example ) which will lead to its demise .

Well I think Iran 's only real crime has been defying US energy interests in the region .

We saw what happened last time Iran defied the US in 1953 under Mossadegh , and the result was a CIA coup to put in someone who would happily bleed their country dry of their resources .

The US have only themslefes to blame for the move to the theocratical tyranny we see now , and most people would agree Iran pose no global threat , but western propaganda representing Iran as some nuclear threat has n't been based on IAEA reports or reason , but as the crescent of the ' axis of evil ',that is those who dare to step out of line .

Whether this is jumping on the back of a popular revolution , or air strikes , who knows , but one is for sure ; an attack would have serious implications , and not just the further destablisation of the region .

I do n't think either the US or the Soviet Union tick the boxes for me .

Neither gained significant land , neither won any significant wars ( indeed , the most famous war America was involved in post WWII was Vietnam , which they flunked ) - hardly characteristics of a traditional superpower .

Superpowers tend to make huge strides in bettering the lives of human civilisation ( the Romans did it by furthering democracy , the British Empire did it with the industrial revolution ) .

These two countries are best known for stockpiling weapons and racing to the moon - not characteristics of being a superpower .

" Hundreds and thousands of years ago , my family lived in Norway , in a consequent town where there were families like mine , making a little clan .

We were then chased from Norway , because we were invaded by Norwegians saying that we were strangers , while it had been our land for centuries and centuries , and we could n't be considered as strangers .

Do you ( asking the class ) think that nowadays , I could go back to Norway , and chase the people living there , with the only argument that my family lived there for hundreds of year ?

Bearing this in mind , do you think that Israelians 's motif for going back to their land is sufficient ? "

Is he racist , or is he realistic ?

To be honest if Norway was the center of his religious beliefs and if he had been persecuted all the years after his family got kicked out he would have a different view .

More importantly he is Christian - and he is ruled by Christian governments .

His family was in Norway , they got conquered and so ceased to own the land .

Well the Arabs that used to live in Israel got ' conquered ' per se - although a much more benign version of conquest - and so no matter what the original motives for the conquest were , they lost the right to that land .

He is neither racist nor realistic - just wrong .

I 'm using extremists lightly , I 'm just using the word as something to categorize them .

They can all inspire hate , change stories and have radical @/@ controversial views .

Extremist Muslism would liek to convert everyoen else...

and BNP just wants to deport foreigners elsewhere...

Hate ( although I believe broadly is a bad thing ) is something I can live with...

Radical @/@ controvesial are n't bad because they 're radical , they 're bad because of the belief itself .

I mean come on...this seriously baffles me .

The BBC are biased against America , and therefore Israel .

During the recent attack on Gaza by Israel the BBC were the only channel to not broadcast an appeal for the innocent Muslims of Gaza . Even though all other channels did .

ROCK ON U.S.A FREE ISRAEL !

I would say ' no ' but they have nuclear weapons and no @-@ one is going to take them away from them .

Gay marriage has been legal in California since May , but this proposition was in favour of eliminating the rights of gay couples to marry .

They should n't be allowed to do an about turn like that for no apparent reason , especially given the fact that it only recently became allowed .

It just really bugs me that it got turned round so soon as well..

They should have just kept it legal and let those who disagree have a grumble and grind their teeth over it all - it 's not like they 're suffering .

California has a huge Roman Catholic population which obviously rejects it , not helped by the large influx of migrant S @-@ American Catholics into the state .

But I think the issue of the right to marry is different because people worked to get the right and to change the law for it to be allowed .

It was n't just a right because no one had told them they could n't do it , like your examples .

Either everyone has the right to marry , or no one does .

Just as nobody has the ' right ' to murder ( which quite frankly I find to be a weak argument due to reasons already mentioned ) , either nobody should have the right to marry , or everybody should .

I would argue that any law that I judge to be unjust is inherently illegitimate and thus I have no moral obligation to follow it or consider it to be a moral principle , nor would I use it to guide my decision making in any more than potentially in a practical sense .

I certainly could not and will not respect the rule of law when it imposes restrictions on two consenting adults expressing their love , and quite frankly I think that such unjust laws undermine the whole system .

You said you had n't considered prisoners not having the vote , and hypothesised that a good reason might be because they should have their rights removed for committing a crime .

And the incest argument is entirely related . If two people are happy together , why can n't they get married ?

You want one rule for all , stand by what you say , instead of dodging the uncomfortable reality that even you 're not happy with everybody having the same rights .

It forced schools to teach same @-@ sex marriage as a morally EQUAL alternative , Cal like the rest of America is full of religious people and they do not see this as right .

It will only take away the right for same @-@ sex couples to call it marriage , everything else is still there .

Well , you 're sort of right ; we 're all being treated as second class citizens , but you sort of missed the point .

The moral outrage ( here , anyway ) associated with one has not been associated with the other simply because one is acceptable and one is n't ; so it 's not the fact that a right has been taken away is wrong , its that you think X should have a right and that right has been taken away so you 're annoyed .

If marriage is defined as a man and a woman then banning gay marriage is perfectly legitimate .

My point still stands : if you need a certificate from the state to live your life in happiness then you are a.) a pathetic individual and b.) a serf .

When are people going to realise that sexual orientation , skin colour and ethnicity has no bearing on what is inside the person and their personality .

As long as you a good person , regardless of anything else then that is all that matters .

Shame on California - It shows what the real attitudes on homosexuality are .

People pretend to be fine with it - but their is ignorance deep inside .

I was reading an article about how we need more black sold models for young black people to aspire to .

Because apparently , all young blacks in Britain need an extra reminder not to commit crimes and be involved in gangs .

That all these initiatives are exclusively targeting young black British people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarms of exclusively black teenagers begging to be part of a gang ) while completely ignoring any other skin colour .

Now obviously not every black male wants to go committing crimes all day , and the evidence suggests that blacks like committing crimes just as little as other skin colours do .

Do people really think that a poor white teenager does n't need support , encouragement or aspiration ?

If the ethnicity and colour of those committing crimes was n't mentioned , it would be much less big a deal . Why this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people is beyond me .

It 's like when we beg for Asian @/@ black police officers .

If they do n't want to do it , they won't .

We should be judged on our merits , not our skin colour .

I believe it 's things like this that make white people believe the country are going against them .

If the government did n't deal with things only to do with race , then I , perhaps naively and idealistically , believe that it would become less of a big deal .

Black role models give black people hope .

It 's not about whether it should or why does it , it just does because black community are a semi @-@ community .

Having to learn about the evilness of white people repeatedly really does n't give white kids the impression that they have a place in our multicultural society .

The reason specific ethnic groups are targeted for trying to reduce crime is because , for whatever reason , crime overall is often higher statistically in these groups .

This is not because their race or culture is wrong or bad in any way , it 's simply a fact that certain groups have higher rates of crime .

Whether it 's the result of poverty or cultural differences and stresses in Britain that are leaving them vulnerable to getting lured into crime , pretending that a group that has more prevalence for crime has n't is just foolish .

I do n't know the statistics , but if black youths are the target of an anti @-@ crime and role @-@ model drive , then it 's probably because they have a higher crime rate than other groups , and because the government wants to make sure that whatever factor it is ( because we know it 's not their race itself ) is addressed so they can have a better future .

And there are schemes targeting white populations , but when there is an imbalance between ethnic groups , it surely has to be a priority to address what is causing this imbalance - if for nothing else then for the sake of equality !

There 's a lot of talk recently about how diversity is necessary , but how far do we go ?

When you look at other western countries like Canada , America , Australia , the vast majority of its immigrants are not white these days and are probably heading for a more diverse future , so much so to the point that these nations will have very different demographic look to them in 50 years time .

They will have great bragging rights you could say when it comes to multiracialism and diversity than Britain or most european countries will maybe not have .

Like I say people brand multiracialism as a good thing , very few want to go back to a 100 % white society but how multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people , particularly liberals ?

I personally think it 's completely necessary but I know many of my opponents will disagree .

Are we still not multiracial enough compared to some of our western rivals ? ?

Mate you are all confused .

I.e. 14 % of the british population is non @-@ white , but 14 % of the tories are not correspondingly non @-@ white .

This is bad because it means certain races are being excluded .

This is COMPLETELY different to asking whether an entire nations population should be a certain skin colour - skin colour should be irrelevant .

It 's absolutely sickening you would want to diminish a race 's presence just for the sake of it .

The issue with places like " white " hollywood is the glass ceiling that keeps minorities AND women out , as there is the feeling ( whether true or not ! ) that there is not a level and fair playing field .

Funny how people come up with imaginary arguments from the " other side ", as I 've never HEARD any of these " liberals " you refer to .

I think , as usual , you 're framing an argument in a way that will make your so called opinion look bad

If a memeber of your family was going an illegal activty would you conact the police about their actions ?

I 'm not going to report my mate for driving at 80 on the motorway but if I suspected he was a serial killer I might be inclined to tell somebody

I do n't know if contacting the police would be the rationale approach .

If i am unsuccessful i 'd get other family members to help and ultimately if they still refuse to listen -- i 'd leave them to their own accord and let them do what they belive is right or wrong .

Because at the end of the day , my conscious would be clear [in the sense that i did try and help them].

Telling the police would not be wise , as you 'd be creating enemies .

If I did n't think they were harming anyone ( smoking dope , illegally downloading music etc ) then I would n't report them ; if they were hurting other people ( violent crime , theft from individuals etc ) then I definitely would .

I would n't go ' ooh , you 've murdered ten people with an axe , but you 're my mum so I won't tell anyone '

The main arguments i hear about this issue is that this country is ' full ' or that there 's enough unemployment as it is .

What exactly makes people feel that British people deserve to remain in this country more than anyone else who just happens to have been born into poverty or war ?

Surely if we 're all equal then no matter where one 's born , they have equal rights to live in the UK as someone born here .

I 'm not against immigration but i think it should be more regulated .

Why ? Because immigration has already caused a lot of " social issues " and until we solve those problems I do n't think its good to just let everyone in .

How should it work : education of english , their intentions , and to what they will contribute and most importantly their ideologies and beliefs .

To those whom the welfare state is the biggest concern I think the problem arises from the fact that there are already too many english people sponging off the state and if we add anymore people be it immigrants or " britons " our state of government would collapse and then our economy .

Because I wish to protect diversity .

If immigration levels are too high , the indigenous populations ' gene pool will eventually become so diluted to essentially be extinct .

So that means that in contrast to the general population they are actually slightly under represented therefore the NHS does not rely on immigrants as much as leftie TSR users claim they do .

but to be honest if you live in a village like manchester , anywhere in the south west of england , or anywhere as a matter of fact in the rest of the UK , all you will find are whites , but in london you will find ethnic people

besides this is from 2005 , I 'm pretty sure that the figures would be different now .

correct me if I 'm wrong .

All i see on TheStudentRoom these days is agitated non @-@ muslims interrogating muslims , criticising their religion ( as any sane person would ) , muslims signing up to the student room JUST to post some anti @-@ israel propaganda to persuade people about how evil israel is or how islam is the religion of peace

it seems that the blood libel rumour of medeival times that Jews kill christian babies to use their blood for wine is today in the form of zionists/jews/israelis killing palestinian babies just because theyre pure evil , and i think the islamic propaganda machine is succeeding in convincing people ?

anything which takes sides against muslims get a million negs - its obvious muslims are in a huge presence on TSR .

Also this is a forum where topics are going to be discussed and these are categorised e.g. religion .

So you have a choice in viewing these threads and not being part of this so called propaganda .

generally they need positive feedback all the time , eithewise they get really agressive .

But when it becomes their life objective to annoy the life out people with their " READ THE QUARAN - OR DIE ! !!" threads , it becomes a bit annoying -@ _ @-

Over the past 1 @-@ 2 years I 've had quite a few discussions with people about current affairs ( namely the issue of terrorism and the related issues of immigration , global politics etc ) and quite often heard a common belief that a british civil war will erupt when ethnic minorities increase in numbers and become more estabished .

As the numbers of minority groups who do n't respect secular law increase they will demand greater autonomy , and mini @-@ vassal states will appear but still remain part of the UK ( like Palestine ) and things will get pretty tense .

So you think that an entire group of people are going to move to the UK after a genocide , and then a state will be established , voted for and partitioned by the United Nations ?

You then think that neighbouring countries will then invade this new state , that the native British people will be forced to flee to like Cornwall ( Gaza ) and Yorkshire , Lincolnshire , Norfolk , Suffolk , Essex and a part of East London ( West Bank ) .

That this new state will be supported by the USA who will provide it with diplomatic protection and weaponry ?

for some people , civilisation seems to rest on how rapists are treated when in custody and not how many rapists actually exist .

something needs to be done obviously the easiest way to stop rape is to deal with rapists a lot tougher and send out a clear message that it is not acceptable .

britain : weak on crime , tough on the victims of crime .

On a serious note rapists should have longer sentences , I would be happy for them to spend their whole lives in prison if it 's beyond practically any doubt they raped someone

It is a crime of massive degrees of difference , I think the mark of a good legal system is that it can deal with every individual crime , rather than simply handing out the same punishment ragrdless of the circumstance .

That said , we could be tougher on all criminals , not just rapists .

Sorry to have to point out the bleeding obvious to the majority of you , but it seems like a minority of users actually have to be told this : do not make troll posts or " jokes " about rape , it is n't funny .

I 'm honestly shocked by that number , I would have thought it would be more than that .

I keep frequently seeing threads made hating on Islam , which is somewhat hypocritical and disturbing I believe in many cases .

I am an Atheist ; therefore I am not trying to defend Islam out of being ' Islamic ' before I am accused of that .

I am also considered by British nationalists to be 100 % British ( Although I reject the idea that it makes a real difference ) , so I am not showing sympathy for Islam out of experiencing similar hostility or racism .

Therefore , I do not believe we should be cherry @-@ picking Islam as some specific evil , but rather opposing all religions for the extremely negative roles they play in the world .

This may be correct , but the fact of the matter is ; whether somebody is using Islam to commit terrible acts , regardless of the wrongdoing , all major religion play a large role in shaping societies , and ultimately , fulfil playing a very similar negative role .

And when using the idea that Islam ‘inspires terrorism’, if we were honestly that bothered about such wrong @-@ doing in the world , then we would surely be more concerned with ending the much more severe crisis 's and wrong @-@ doing 's such as starvation and war .

Both of these ills are far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism , as of which we are more liking to die by our own hands rather than by the hand of an ' Islamic terrorist '.

It is almost unbelievable how the idea that a Christian should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for Islam , when the religion they subscribe to right now in Britain , is playing a much more negative role .

I have no expectation that I will be receive any support for my remarks by Christians or other adherents of major religions .

I am an atheist and I think Islam is the most inherently evil religion out of all the other ones .

I would choose to live in a christian society over a Muslim one any day .

As an atheist I can differentiate between Islam and Christianity , in that Christianity is progressive , whilst Islam is not .

But sometimes it does no come under as much criticism ( for small cases , not the religions as a whole ) as other religions because people just get labelled racist .

I know everybody is gonna neg me as racist but someone has to say it .

Similarly to how not all claims are created equal , and individual claims require differing levels of evidence , neither are all religions created equal and it is rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be shown to be more detrimental to another .

So it is irrelevant that you believe all religion plays a negative role , even though I agree with you , because our priorities should be focused on those which are the most detrimental .

I would also like you to back up your assertion that Christianity , which in this country is in a weak and almost laughable form , is playing a more negative role in Britain 's society than Islam is right now .

Also , reading your posts you appear to be a highly arrogant , self @-@ righteous , and cocky person .

Time to get some humility and eat some humble pie , because I guarantee you 're going to be wrong on countless things throughout your life .

If you compare a traditionally Christian/Buddhist/whatever country to a traditionally Islamic country in terms of stability , equality , safety and crime , quality of life etc , there 's a good chance the non @-@ Islamic one is going to come out on top ( there would likely be exceptions , but as a general rule.)

That is one reason why people perceive it to be worse for society .

People go crazy when seeing celebrities , faint when they touch them and track their each and every movements via magazines , hell there 's a subforum dedicated to them on this site !

Why do we feel the need to elevate people to celebrity status and worship them ? I really do n't understand how this culture emerged and why .

Must have something to do with providing people with gods to worship and adore in an age in which gods have been killed . By doing so , I guess , many people are saved from nihilism as a result of the loss of values from the death of God . Thus , superstars and rockstars are put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like . If we were living in ancient Rome , for example , the superstars and rockstars would be the heroic gladiators , but the best gladiators were often thought of as gods in their own right . They were supposedly treated like gods . Ceasar himself was worshipped as a god by the people . The gods of yestreday are the stars of today . When charles Atlas became famous they were saying he was a god . Great individuals are sometimes regarded as more than human by their fans . Fred Astair , Al Jolson , Charlie Chaplin , James Dean , Marlon Brando , Elvis , Sinatra , Bruce Lee , Bowie , Morrissey , boy bands like Take That , Lady Gaga and the like .

i think its disgusting that the death of a drink and drug adict got 15 seperate articles on the bbc news website , and there wasnt even a mention of the british soldier killed in the same week . people need to get priorities in order

I can n't recall hearing of this much before the riots of late , so I wonder whether it will become a regular crime from now on .

It does n't have to occur alongside a riot , but carefully planned and limited to a close circle , it could be a very lucractive crime .

If a circle of 10 @-@ 15 target a high @-@ end retailer during a perfectly normal shopping day , perhaps at a strategic location and time , I do n't really see what could stop them from looting a shop with lots of valuable merchandise within proximity of the entrance e.g. luxury clothes shop .

Are you trying to set something up or what ?

That 's different though , the riots were promoted like a chain letter , were n't they , rather than a plot between a few people who all actually knew each other , and therefore could be rounded up fairly easily .

And surely it 's just " looting " because it was still associated with general civil unrest .

But people will see the footage of them carrying off luxury goods for nothing and even posing alongside plasmas .

Apparently it was in a multicultural office . My arse it was .

Even our own English people arent even allowed to do anything because it will offend these immigrants...

Im offended by backwards baseball caps and chewing gum , doesnt mean im going to abolish it "

Okay , i meant to say banned , not arrested .

Id like to make this clear , its not the muslims were having a go at , but the officials .

They recieved complaints ( could be muslims , we dont know ) , and the officials said breastfeeding is offfensive to muslims .

I think its because this country is afraid of muslims - suicide bombers , poppy burners , stoning people to death.... you know the story .

These officials are saying its offensive because they want to go on the muslims good side and not make any enemies .

It 's not up to Muslims if she breastfeeds her child her not .

Telling her to feed her baby in a toilet is also ridiculous .

Muslims are n't offended by breastfeeding , it is just the labour councillor of the multicultural office saying ' it will offend them '

People like this just end up creating arguments between 2 different religions @/@ communities for no reason what so ever

How much of a **** do you have to be to design a curriculum without critical thinking on it ?

If you can ban something somebody else does based on your faith , everybody else can ban things you do based on their faith .

If you want everybody else to use reasoning with you , you have to use reasoning with them .

- Those who murder deserve to have the same done to them

- It 's inhumane and barbaric , the criminal may be able to be reformed

Ultimately , I really do n't know how I stand on this issue . Up until recently I was very much in favour of it . I 'd say that maybe it should be used in extreme circumstances but it 'd be difficult to know when not to execute someone .

To be honest I 'm for it if it 's cheaper . Other than that , meh . I think being in isolation for years at a time would be worse than a quick death , although I 'm not sure .

I would n't support it for first time offenses , but when a criminal is given a second chance and reoffends , I 'm all for it... I mean , if the evidence is 100 % conclusive that is , which is the case most of the time now with modern technology etc

As it happened I was the only British person on the bus , and when asked I said that I was from ' England '.

The guide then said , ' no you 're not , you 're from the United Kingdom ' and started making a big deal out of it and I got quite embarassed .

I was actually really angry at that though because I identify far more as English than I do as British .

When we were in the pub later on , two Argentinians also commented , saying that they did n't think it was right for him to say that , as you would n't expect a Scottish person to say that they were from the UK .

Is it only the English who are n't allowed this kind of pride in where they live ?

Personally I find it nonsensical to be proud of something you have n't chosen or done , but it 's up to you if you want to be proud where you come from .

I could n't care less really what my nationality was , it 's just letters on a passport ,

I still wonder what my identity is , a human being , a Brit , a European ?

No , I prefer to call myself a overgrown monkey .

You are allowed to state where you 're from .

I do n't think there 's anything massively wrong to to feel a sentimental pride towards your country ,

it is human nature to feel attached to where you come from .

It is nationalism that becomes an issue .

His jumping down your throat was his problem .

You 're from the UK and England so in my opinion which ever one you choose to identify yourself as you are correct .

In the 2001 census , the question of what people 's religious affiliations were , and many people decided to put " Jedi " in the hope that it would be recognised as an official religion .

It was n't . But 390,000 people decided tocall themselves Jedis anyway .

I kinda expected more Jedis to be out there , although in all honesty , I would say that I have n't actually seen anyone wielding a lightsaber , so that may be flawed .

I just thought that seven in every thousand people is a bit small , since the campaign was well @-@ publicised , and there were no repurcussions for not telling the truth on the religion question .

I know quite a few Jews put down ''Jedi'' on the census as they did n't want government records that they were Jewish - that 's how Hitler managed to find all the Jews so easily - it was all kept carefully on detailed and accurate notes .

On the other hand it can be said that they should know who practices what as they run the country and can thus make laws according the proportionate numbers of each faith etc.

- As a Jew and having experienced anti @-@ Semtism myself ( as many Jews have and do ) I would sway towards the former view in terms of safety , but I can understand why people would disagree with this and choose the latter .

The main finding , as mentioned in the title , is that for the first time a full 50 % of British people no longer associate themselves with any religion , and over half of the people that do affiliate with a religion never attend religious services or meetings , with only 14 % attending such events on a weekly basis .

Nice to see that those lacking a religion are now a majority , although thankfully UK Christians tend to be very reserved and moderate unlike their US counterparts .

Though undoubtedly many of the responses on this thread will still use the 2001 census as a reliable source for religious demographics despite the fact it 's ten years old .

Will be interesting to compare this to the census data when it 's released .

I am regaining my faith in humanity .

America is probably a lost cause , but I 'm pleased to see we 're going Scandinavian .

Nor am I saying that other religions do n't have followers that do things that are similar and worse .

Children were seen to be showing disrespect and a lack of caring .

Even if you claim that animals and humans simply are n't equal , it does not justify harming them .

It would be like claim I am above someone else therefore I can do what I want to them .

So why would you put animals intentionally through unnecessary pain and suffering ?

During the Hajj , Muslims remember and commemorate the trials and triumphs of the Prophet Abraham ( as ) .

The meat from the sacrifice of Eid al @-@ Adha is mostly given away to others although there is no limit to what may be eaten or given in charity or used to feed the poor or the rich or even if one wants to give it away cooked or uncooked .

The method of slaughter is similar to the one used throughout the whole world , by Muslims and non @-@ Muslims .

The most important difference though is that in Islam , you are obligated to put the animal under as little pain as possible and to treat it humanely ( during the slaughter and every instant of it 's live before it ) .

I have seen an animals throat slit and it survived and was in a lot of pain .

Before any Muslim says " it was n't done properly , " do n't talk that crap .

However the pig squealed in agony and was still running until it bled out .

If you have a problem with the slaughter of animals , you should be vegetarian and disapprove of all slaughter , which I assume you are .

Why this has anything to do with Islam and a festival where lambs are slaughtered for the poor in memory of Ibrahim 's ( Abraham 's ) loyalty to God I do not see .

Oh and btw , a few years ago I was in a town near my home city in India with my family for qurbani - and literally the people there were starving and malnourished beyond belief .

To such people , the pain of an animal is the last thing on their mind .

I only mention because it is so easy to view things from a Western first world perspective , which is why we also criticise Chinese fur farms where furs are stripped from animals when they are alive causing unbelievable pain for incredibly long extended periods , but to a Chinese family in the remote rural regions , it is their only source of bread and butter - and trust me , these people who really do not know whether they will get another meal ( unlike the gluttony we engage in 24 @/@ 7 since birth here in the West ) think very differently from us - and justifiably so .

The recent case of the Christian pastor in Iran has given me cause to ponder the question in the thread title .

Here we have a man who knows that his life is in great peril if he refuses to recant his Christian faith , yet that is exactly what he does .

His possible martyrdom parallels that of the Apostles who evangelised in the knowledge that what they were doing would likely get them killed .

I often wonder if I would be so brave if I were in their shoes

Would you sacrifice yourself in defence of your faith ?

yes , without doubt , yes I will sacrifice myself in defence of my faith .

God did sacrifice Himself for us , so I thought it 's sensible for us to sacrifice ourselves for our religion .

Even if I was religious I doubt I would ever die for my religion .

Do you think it gets you an automatic ticket to heaven ?

What about your family and friends ?

If someone holds a gun to your head and demmands you recant , just f***ing do it ! !

It doesnt mean anything , god isnt going to deny you access to heaven because you made a perfectly rational decision under intense pressure

I 've been watching some of his videos and I definitely think he has a right to criticize religion if he wants to .

But I find a lot of the time he makes such sweeping statements and sometimes unnecessary insults that annoy me .

What do you think of him and his videos ?

He 's a bit aggressive , raves and rants a lot , and mixes up a lot of different political stances into one bundle when many are in no way related , but beyond that....

Everytime when I watch him , I think to myself " Okay , we get it .

I 've seen an actual photograph of an actual person in an actual Bigfoot costume .

For any who were n't already aware Huntster believes he came upon a sasquatch trackway and I while camping with friends on Vancouver Island several years ago found two sets of tracks and had a close range audio encounter with what at the time I attributed to sasquatch( es @- at the time I thought there was an adult and juvenile ) but now I discount the event as inconclusive and likely mistaken identity given the spurious nature of BF evidence .

However , I still fel pretty confident I could rule out hoaxing because of the remoteness of the area .

I actually surfed in after a year because I wanted to hear the JREF side on this issue . No one appears to have posted about this yet .

Apparently , the two folks that died paid nearly 10,000 dollars to attend the new age sweat led by two time Oprah guest .

20 people became ill , and one more is still in critical condition tonight .

From what I understand , it sounds like Ray did n't know what the hell he was doing , because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space .

Apparently they are still wanting to question the guy .

A few weeks ago me and a few friends watched a TV show on Discovery ( their house not mine ! ) where a guy claims to have recovered from a coma with a newfound ability...

he can play the piano like an expert .

He says he can n't write music , but he sees musical notes in his mind and he can " miraculously " play them seemingly perfect , or close to it .

He claims to have no musical training and has never played an instrument in his life .

I can n't remember his name...I think he is in the U.S.

For musicians : I wonder how he would handle key signatures since he says the notes just fly by in his mind .

Perhaps he is a failed musician and saw an opportunity to get into the limelight .

I would think people in his life would know that he could play previously , but as we all know , believers won't care , or simply claim that these people are lying .

The ability to play the Piano and other instruments to a high level not only involves technical ability but also physical training ( remember the first time you tried to span notes on a Guitar or piano ? )

How is it possible he woke with all his Piano playing muscles fully developed ?

Well in the case of the guy Sacks writes about , it was more a matter of waking up to a newfound passion for the piano , not that he woke a fully developed piano player .

He claims to have been a guy who listened to rock music before the accident , but afterward could n't get enough of piano music , started to sit down at a piano to play , and then more and more often , and then he was hearing music in his head , and it just became an obsession .

So nothing really mystical about it . The man himself seems to put a spiritual spin on it , but it makes sense all the same without it .

His music is unstructured ; it sounds like he 's just playing whatever comes into his head .

He looks like he 's just stabbing at the next note he wants to play .

I do n't know if you guys have followed potholer54 's channel on youtube , but his series of delightfully devastating and withering videos on climate science and creationism are something to behold .

I 'm aware of realclimate.org , have read a few articles and what not over the last few months .

The response was of course tongue and cheek , a commentary on the nonsense that you can n't have a meaningful discussion without hot links .

Not only that , but if you believe the current models to be accurate , we need to reduce the effects of CO2 now .

So this could have been in the science , music , or current events forum and if any mods should choose to move it , that will be fine with me .

I 'm watching the Grammys and they 've put on a tribute to Glenn Campbell including Campbell singing Rhinestone Cowboy .

It amazes me that people are being diagnosed when they still have enough thought capacity to discuss their fate .

Being rich , I hope he gets to try the new treatment recently successfully used on mice .

So why did I post this and make it about Glenn Campbell instead of just about the science ?

It just struck me hearing the announcement Campbell had Alzheimer 's at the same time he was still well enough to appear on stage at the Grammy 's .

And the discovery of a treatment that is a drug already approved for use in humans should make a bit different of a pathway for research .

If you were wealthy or simply had access to the drug , and had Alzheimer 's would you use it immediately instead of waiting for conclusive studies ?

I had this discussion with Linda ( fls ) in the past and I really wish she had n't left the forum because i 'd like to use this example to revisit the discussion .

I can n't speak for her but I got the impression she would wait for the research to be more conclusive .

I use the criteria : if it is not harmful and there is some evidence it might work , and if there is no better alternative , I think it is worth trying .

Our brain is who we are , and without memories we are just animals .

You risk almost nothing , to gain everything .

My feeling is that when I grow old enough that I 've " had a good run , " why not donate my body to science before I die ?

If I have some disease that will kill me in a few months or years anyway , then , by all means , experiment on me with some new drug that has potential .

And if I have some issue that won't kill me for awhile , well , what the hell if the new drug causes some side effects ?

I can always stop taking it .

Either way , there is some chance that I 'll help people younger than I am .

And once I die , then take my body and do whatever is useful with it .

At age 72 , with the possibility of Alzheimer 's looming in my future , I would take any supplement or drug -- experimental or otherwise -- that may prevent or delay this dreaded condition .

Many conjectures like NSAIDs , simvastatin , fish oil have come and gone .

I have and will continue to try them all until they are proven ineffective or seriously harmful .

Though I expect that little will be found outside of micro @-@ organisms , I have hopes that there will be discoveries similar to those around the black smokers .

They may have to wait until after Xmas .

The huge interconnected lakes about two miles below antarctic ice can n't be touched because they must be under enormous pressure .

I would think that to drill into them would cause a collapse of hundreds of miles of ice , erupting water , flooding and wiping out area the size of Victoria ?

So , I guess I 'll take my chances .

I would like to know what scale they 're using , because different seismic scales can result in enormously different results .

The first was M7+ but did only minor damage and caused no fatalities due to a low Mercalli Intensity reading ( actual measure of intensity of shaking in a particular place ) .

The second M6.3 quake registered at X ( Intense ) and higher on the Mercalli Intensity scale and had the highest peak ground acceleration ever recorded .

In terms of energy released , the deadly Christchurch quake was not particularly big , but in terms of shaking intensity it was one of the most destructive quakes ever recorded .

Japan 's " Shindo " scale is like the Mercalli Intensity Scale , but does n't have anywhere near as many divisions .

The highest category is 7 which seems to equate with VIII on the Mercalli scale ( it goes up to XII ) .

This basically means a Scale 7 quake could be anything from a decently sized but not overly destructive quake right up to a city @-@ leveling event .

There 's no reason to believe that we could get the US , Mexico and Canada to ever agree on a common currency .

Iran taking great control and spreading rebellion against US ?

America had been toying with the idea of " revisiting " Iraq ever since the first war ended , particularly in 1998 , when Saddam first started getting coy with the inspectors .

It did n't get much traction then because America was , at the time , experiencing a resurgance of isolation after the end of the Cold War .

The real reason is that Saddam was a petty dictator who weilded an inordinate amount of influence and was continually giving the impression that he was Up To Something .

Whether he actually was or not was n't the point .

Even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue , ask yourselves if that issue is actually related to what the protest is about .

There will be , and probably already are , many factions who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a DNC fundraiser .

The partisans on both sides will try and expand their trenches such that your movement falls into them .

It 's a collection of every wingnut cause out there , from Ron Paultards to communists to anarchists to anti @-@ Israel to people who like to dress as zombies .

They protest corporations even as they organize on Facebook and Twitter and Youtube using laptop computers and smart phones , all fruits of corporations .

They want to end capitalism , while also getting better pay .

They interviewed some of them on NPR the other day .

One guy admitted they did n't have a cohesive message and he was n't sure if they could have one considering the disparate groups that were there .

He also acknowledged the irony of using large corporations like Verizon to get the message out and using the McDonalds to go to the bathroom .

I do n't know if they though they were being edgy , but that 's a pretty stupid thing to print .

Why was it a " stupid thing to print " - opinion pieces as far as I know are meant to be opinions and it may surprise some folk but not everyone holds the same opinions as they do .

Given that news papers often print opinion pieces to raise interest in their title it seems that it is far from being a pretty stupid thing to print as we are talking about the newspaper...

But virtually ever culture in the world has some form of marriage...a concept in which a life @-@ long union is idealized , where there are formal ceremonies to ' sanctify ' a man and a woman ( or multiples thereof ) . Cultures where , from childhood , children are raised and taught these ideals to the point where most of us think it is a natural part of human nature .

The FORM of marriage may differ from culture to culture , but it is consistent throughout our cultures .

That is , except for at least one very unique culture , the Mosuo , a Chinese minority group who live in the Himalayan mountains , close to the border with Tibet .

Two years ago , I established a non @-@ profit organization to work with the Mosuo , focusing on a variety of aspects ( education , development , etc.), but also on promoting awareness of their culture , and to trying to preserve it .

Children are raised not only without an expectation of spending their life with that one special person , but they often do n't even know ( or care ) who their biological father is .

In the Mosuo culture , men and women can change and choose partners as they please .

Monogamy is not considered special or even particularly desirable .

Thus , women tend to the the ones in control of relationships .

Traditionally , a Mosuo woman will invite a man to spend the night with her .

The man will come to her home at night , sneaking in through her window ( it is also a part of the Mosuo culture that , while everyone knows this is happening , it should be done in a manner that is not obvious ) , spending the night , and then leaving early the next morning before everyone wakes up .

Thus the term " walking marriage "...because the men must walk to and from their assigned rendevous each night .

The Mosuo walking marriages are generally the most interesting -- and misunderstood -- aspects of Mosuo culture .

One of the most common misperceptions is that the Mosuo are very promiscuous , changing partners all the time .

That is patently not true ; in fact , many Mosuo pairing will last for years , and even decades .

There is no social stigma if someone DOES change partners often , but it is more common for the Mosuo to engage in what has been described as " serial monogamy "...that is , they do n't stick with one partner for their whole life , but each pairing will tend to last for an extended period , and they won't generally have multiple partners while in a relationship .

First , even among couples who are together for months/years/decades , they generally will never actually live together , or share property .

The man will continue to live in his family 's home , and his responsibilities are to that family ; while the woman will continue to live her her home , and be responsible to her family .

And what if they have a baby ? In general , fathers have little or no responsibility for children produced from such unions ;

the baby will be raised in the mother 's home , and be a part of her family , not the father 's .

However , that does not mean that the men have no responsibility...it is just that the focus of that responsibility is shifted .

In most cultures , a man will be responsible to care for his own children ;

in Mosuo culture , a man is responsible to care for the children of his sisters/nieces/aunts/etc . So Mosuo men still have full parenting responsibilities...perhaps even moreso , since they may end up sharing responsibility for the children of many family members .

Now , in some cases , Mosuo men DO want to be involved in their own childrens ' upbringing .

If that is the case , after the child is born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gifts , asking to be accepted as the father .

If the matriarch accepts him , he is then an ' honorary member ' of the family , and has the right to visit and @/@ or stay there like any other family member , and to help raise the child .

Although this sounds very strange at first , it actually provides remarkable stability for the children .

First , they are not raised by just one parent ; everyone in the family shares in parental duties , so the child really ends up having multiple father and mother figures .

Furthermore , if the mother and father end their relationship , there is virtually no impact or stress for the child .

There 's no fighting over splitting property , because they never shared property .

There 's no fighting over custody of the child , because the child never belonged to the father to begin with .

The mother 's relationships with different men may change , but it has little or no effect on the children .

One more thing I 'd like to point out . While this system actually works very effectively for the Mosuo , it works ONLY in a situation where there is a large extended family to provide support .

After all , caring for a baby without its father when you have 20 other people in your home to help you is one thing ;

caring for a baby without its father when you live by yourself is another matter entirely .

For more information about the Mosuo , their culture , and our work with them , you can check out our organization 's website . And I welcome questions and comments about this , or other aspects of Mosuo culture .

While their way of life holds no particular allure to me ( my job consists of sitting , writing on paper and thinking about things , I am allergic to horses , my greatest joy is my western traditional family of my wife and 2 daughters ) I applaud your efforts to provide as unobtrusive assistance to these people as possible .

Diversity of cultures and thinking is a Good Thing , and I like your organizations emphasis on putting them in control .

I would suggest that you do n't worry about people who suggest that you try to protect them somehow from the outside world .

If the Mosuo do n't want you or your organization 's help , I am sure they are quite capable of telling you to get lost .

When you say " we " are doing this , who is " we "?

There 's a lot -- well , by linguistics standards , a lot -- of money floating around for doing exactly this , and it sounds like Mosuo is one language that might be saveable if you can bring it to the attention of the appropriate professionals .

So depending upon who the linguists you are bringing in are , it may be possible @/@ practical to get some real heavyweights to come in for their support....

Wolfman , sounds like you 're doing some amazing work !

I do n't know if property was owned by females but it was transferred through the female line ( a man 's heirs would be his sister 's children ) .

Very interesting . What this shows , I think , is that while there is no marriage , there is also no illegitimacy -- that is , most children ( a ) know who their fathers are ( and the fathers do not deny it , even if they have no role in caring for them ) and ( b ) have two male and female adults ( mother and her brother ) take care of them .

In general , most men will be responsible for raising , roughly , the same number of children as they have , even if they do n't raise their own children .

However , if you are a man who has too many partners -- or , more important , too many children -- you are probably seen as a freeloader : someone who makes society take care of their many children while only caring for a few of society 's children in return .

You have to wonder why this is not big news and her hearings kinda faded out of the spotlight...

I am sure their genitalia will make a lot of difference when ti comes time to make a decision...

I 've enabled multiple choice for this poll because I 'd like you to select which 3 candidates will finish in the top 3 in New Hampshire .

In two of the more recent polls , between 35 @-@ 40 % of NH voters say they are either " likely to change their mind " or " undecided/uncommitted ".

I 'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine .

The consensus appears to be that Mitt Romney needs a big win in NH in order to propel him in SC since his Iowa result was almost to the vote the same total as 2008 .

In ' 08 , Mitt finished 2 nd to McCain in NH and got 32 % of the vote .

Inexplicably , he avoided an onslaught of attacks over the last few weeks as the focus turned on Newt , but now one of the big questions becomes about what Republicans really think about the idea of Mitt cleaning up in NH and quite possibly everywhere else , too .

I think that like Iowa , he 'll hold on to the support in NH he got last time .

So he 'll come down to earth a little bit but won't totally implode there .

Everybody needs to see the Iowa speeches .

He 's so much more interesting when he 's an attack dog and he is positioning himself now as wanting to be the fullback to Rick Santorum ; if he 's going down , he wants to take Romney with him , and in the meantime that 'll let Santorum have a positive week and float above the fray .

Rick Santorum is leaving evangelical country and going into a 60 % Catholic state .

I think if Mitt comes down to the low 30 's and it appears that Santorum keeps coming up and can crack 25 % again , it 'll be another soft @-@ boiled Mitt non @-@ win win .

If Newt and Santorum now represent the more traditional GOP establishment and are fighting over that share in NH , Ron Paul and John Huntsman are sharing the Independent vote .

Ron Paul appears ready to keep cruising around 20 % and another top 3 finish .

Rick Perry is totally insignificant and should have quit along with Michele Bachmann .

That 's going to come down to earth , but how much , and how much before it 's perceived that he 's falling and somebody else is rising ?

I think the threshold is that he needs to win by 10 % in order to gain any kind of traction as the front @-@ runner .

Paul 22 % ( 22 )

Bachmann 5 % ( 5 )

I would be distinctly and pleasantly surprised if Huntsman made the top three and absolutely tickled pink if he won , but I do n't see it happening .

Huntsman 's going to have to get some notice at the debate to finish in the top 3 .

If the others are attacking themselves like children , than maybe he can come up the middle and seem like the adult in the room and then NH will make a statement by elevating him to the anti @-@ Romney surging candidate in that state .

You are probably right , Romney and Paul for sure , but once the light shines on Santorum , the NH voters are n't going to like what they see .

Huntsman has n't had a turn being Someone Else yet , and he 's more appealing to NH voters than Santorum .

Romney by a big number , because he lives in NH in a palatial home on Lake Winnipesaukee , and he 's been working on this primary for 5 years .

Paul because he 'll draw a lot of independent voters , and I think Gingrich is fading along with Perry .

This is all going down to how much the anti @-@ Romney vote starts to close the divide .

In the Suffolk poll for Wednesday , it was Romney 43 % and Santorum 6 % .

From a 37 point gap to a 33 point gap . Now , if it 's 37 points after one day , but the two @-@ day total is 33 , that means the second @-@ day stand alone would be 39 to 10 , a 29 point gap .

Ron Paul is sailing with his strong 20 % .

I would love to see something like this run on national television .

It has no place on television because it does n't speak to the undecideds .

The ideal Chaplin espouses here , will never die , and only get pushed back , to arise again .

Humanity can indeed be thankful for that , that we only go through stages of insanity , and have the chance of overcoming that .

But he would have to cut his ties to the greedy .

I keep hearing tons of people run off at the mouth about how dangerous Ron Paul 's foreign policies are and how they are out of touch with the real world .

I 've been on two deployments and my job is an Arabic linguist of 10 years .

Our interference does , indeed , cause more problems for us than what we are trying to stop .

We supported the rebels in Egypt and it 's now being taken over by radicals .

I find that the Judge is actually one of a few mainstream conservatives that has a shred of honesty and actually understand what conservatism is .

If someone had only bombed the reactors in Israel and South Africa , while the US and other countries had prosecuted and imprisoned all the traitors who leaked nuclear weapons information and gave the necessary technology to them...

The US is largely directly to blame for the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its " Atoms for Peace " program .

But back on topic , if Ron Paul is " kooky " then so are most other politicians in any country on the planet .

911 was blowback from us sticking our nose in business that is not our business .

With that said , I still want to kill anyone who is responsible in the planning , or anyone who shields these people .

They thought they had valid reasons to attack us . And perhaps they did .

They were hoping to wound us gravely by attacking our financial system . A weak link in our chain .

They should have just saved those lives , because we allowed banking to fuck our system up greater than AQ could have ever done .

I think that a lot of people automatically assume that anyone who says our foreign policy is why they are angry at us is also justifying their response .

It is understandable they are upset , but neither Ron Paul nor anyone else who is supporting him is saying their response was in any way justified .

Indiscriminately targeting women and children is cowardly and people who do that should be captured or killed .

I really am tired of hearing that they hate us because we are free or because of our beliefs .

It would be like you building a shack in my backyard and every now and then one of my dogs goes missing , then when I get upset that it is there you say I am mad because you have bacon burger Fridays in your own house back on your property and I hate bacon ( which is clearly only a hypothetical as I love bacon ) .

Why ? Because experts do n't agree with him on his kooky policy stands , which are manifold :

*denounces the Civil Rights Act because it infringed the free @-@ market right of a monolithic white establishment to immiserate blacks ;

*suggests that the border fence is being built to keep Americans from leaving the country ;

*claims that Social Security and Medicare are unconstitutional and should be dismantled ;

*mounts repeated warnings that hyperinflation is right around the corner ( tsquare , take a bow ) ;

*hinted that maybe the CIA helped to coordinate the 9 @/@ 11 attacks ;

*and alleges that the UN wants to confiscate our guns .

And this list does n't even get into all the racism and homophobia of his newsletters , which used his name , were signed by him and which raised thousands of dollars which he was happy to pocket but have been disavowed by him now that they are a liability .

My friend and I walked into a pizza shop .

If we both got two slices each , that would make it 4 slices at a total of $ 12 .

We were assured the slices in the 12 @-@ slice were the same size , so we got that .

We each pitched in $ 5 each ( which can n't even buy you two slices oddly enough ) and got 6 slices each , which we 've just polished off in fairly record time .

We pooled our resources and struck the better deal for the both of us , and we actually made a joke about proud and full communists .

Now we 're rolling a joint from a bag of weed we each pitched in on in order to save money as well .

Got our usual amount of weed each , but each paid $ 5 less because one of us did the transaction and bought twice as much as usual for the individual .

If these things make me a communist , than I 'll drink to that , but I just call it better business sense mostly .

Real communism would be they could go get a pizza without paying at all , and the pizza guy could come by their auto @-@ parts place to pick up a distributor cap without paying at all .

The problem you are having Jason Marcel is that it is impossible for many people , and especially people in America , to conceive of cooperation and sacrifice without force behind it .

They are so locked into their little me @-@ centric universes that they can n't see cooperating with someone else unless someone makes them .

Seriously , I think the problem here is that a lot of people in the U.S. , conservatives especially , when they hear the word " communism " think of the Soviet Union .

Not only was the Soviet Union not communist , it did n't even pretend to be .

When communism is reached , socialism is no more , because socialism presumes the existence of the state , and under communism there is no state .

The motto under socialism is " from each according to his ability , to each according to his WORK." Under communism , it 's the more @-@ familiar , " from each according to his ability , to each according to his NEED ."

It never pretended to be communist , even though it was governed by something called the Communist Party .

Communism was what they were in theory evolving towards , but certainly not what they already had .

If it were possible to have a communist society , it would be a wonderful thing .

EDIT : I answered " no " to the poll , because although communism is a beautiful dream , I consider it no more than that .

Though he 's kind of old , he is still sharp and incredibly intelligent - and consistent .

His voting record is very consistent and he does n't vote for any legislation that is n't expressly allowed by the Constitution .

Given this , the grassroots support he had in 2008 , and the fact that his message is very closely aligned with that of the tea party movement , do think he could head either a tea party ( or more likely ) GOP ticket .

I really think given Paul 's astoundingly consistent message and voting record ( and reputation ) that he could mount a serious challenge to Obama . W

Paul/Palin , has a nice ring to it .

Once again the Republican solution is a geriatric nut , only this time it 's a relgious fanatic instead of senile warmonger .

Hillary won't be " too old " in 2016 , but she will still be too Hillary .

But foremost he is not a career politician as his profession is actually an academic one , partly in the US where he also studied .

Papademos seems to be well respected in the EU but also within Greece , as far as a Greek Prime minister could be respected in a country like Greece where being politician has a worse reputation than being a bank robber .

On another note . There are rumors that Mario Monti could become the next prime minister of Italy .

Monti , also dubbed " Super Mario ", is a former EU commissioner and will still ring some bells for example in Redmond , simply because it was him who did not shy away from taking a fight with an extreme heavyweight like Microsoft over anti @-@ trust issues .

If both news would be true , this would make the dark horizon look a little less dark indeed .

These two men would be the best choice for their respective countries in times like these in my humble opinion .

They know economics , have a reputation of being not involved in corruption , dare to do what they believe has to be done and are convinced Europeans .

Personally i was hoping for Eva Kaili , but obviously for different reasons .

He was n't the head of the ECB but one of the Vice Presidents , ie in the governing council of the ECB . For all the shortcomings of the Euro , I can n't see how the ECB has done a bad job .

He seems to be a really clever guy , understanding economics like few prime ministers in the world probably , as he teaches it in Harvard I think .

Well at least it would have made the newspapers look more interesting...

Well , she 's not the most attractive woman in the world but for a politician there are n't many hotter out there...

I think i have a thing for blonde women...

anyhow , so seeing as i can find myself talking positively about a socialist like this , is n't it your turn to talk about Palin like this in threads about the Tea Party ?

Btw , i think given her experience in journalism and TV media , she would have done a good job relaying the message of what the essential need of bailout measures were , to the Greek people .

She also was very respectful in her final days of dissent in the previous coallition , and did n't even call for him to resign .

I think I 'm one of those who likes watching the Superbowl for all the new ads .

Ferris Bueller was alright and Seinfeld was pretty funny , but Clint Eastwood 's ad for Chrysler makes them the winner two years in a row after Eminem 's wicked ad for them last year .

I believe Eastwood is speaking from the heart , that 's why I think it 's such an amazing and curious ad since it looks and feels so much like the kind of thing the Obama campaign would find favorable to them .

Clint Eastwood is a lifelong moderate conservative .

Voted for Nixon twice because the man promised to end the war .

Has n't endorsed anyone in that field yet , but says he likes Ron Paul .

He says he would n't call himself a hardcore conservative or an extreme lefty .

From the stuff he is for and against in recent years , it paints a picture of the kind of voter that will decide the election , and I think Eastwood taps into that feeling of wanting to make a comeback happen .

There 's something to be gained by this guy 's performance , a man of rugged self @-@ reliance who also took the time to acknowledge in the ad that " we all pulled together ", his tip of that of course to the bailouts which he is supportive of .

Its half time in america and beer costs more because alcohol tax increases , your so hapy to be here at the game instead of your crowded house ( it 's been packed since your brother @-@ inlaw lost his job and home ) , your credit card bill is going to be major after the game , homeland security will be investigating you because of a glitch in the facial i.d . software at the enterance , your job is being outsourced next wek , your team is losing millions in endorsements , a major corporation paid millions to sell their foreign made wares to you for justt a few seconds , and your car is being repoed in the lot .

I loved the ad till I saw that it was for Chrysler . Considering they are owned by Fiat , " Imported from Detroit " is a good slogan .

Still a good ad , no matter who made it .

There were high expectations , considering all the prices they won with the Darth Vader one last year , but I think they managed to pull it off .

I do n't even know what a Fiat is but after last night 's commercial I 'm buying two .

I have a hankering to send someone flowers via Teleflora too .

All and all , I thought it was a very down year for Super Bowl commercials and I did n't even notice the Chrysler one .

It was a bit too political for my tastes but I do n't really care if car companies want to spend a fortune on Obama ads .

I 'm a happy camper as along as I 'm allowed to cast my vote for who I think is the better candidate and make my annual political contribution of $ 0.00 to all campaigns .

But they have become infected , and are really sick .

They are not team players , they are so individualistic that it has become detrimental to the nation pulling together , working together .

It really is sad , in its most basic sense , because it hinders fixing what their " every man is an Island " philosophy that is tearing apart the fabric of society .

Forget Guantanimo , forge the Gulags , the CHOGM 2011 opening that Australia made the Queen and various sundry Heads of State sit through was just plain EVIL .

If the Queen was n't turning up this would n't have much coverage here .

A bunch of foreign looking folk all in one place only gets coverage if a crime is committed ( they 'll get blamed , even if they are the victim ) .

There has been a small amount of coverage of Mr Rajapaksa 's problems , but since the government is n't going to charge him wiht anything it goes under the category of ' Greens bluster '.

I 'll even provide nice hollow point ammo for them to use .

Two men enter , one man leaves .

Mary Travers , part of the trio of Peter , Paul and Mary died yesterday after battling leukemia for many years .

I grew up listening to their music and got the chance to see them perform when I lived in VA .

I remember this group , and love some of their songs .

I can never hear that song without imagining an AC @-@ 47 or AC @-@ 130 type gunship lazily swinging around in a constant circle , with sci @-@ fi lasergun @-@ looking tracers pouring out like evil glowing rain...

Hey folks @- I just found out that Debbie had an apparently small fire at her house this morning .

I just talked to her and she 's home and physically fine and dealing with the immediate aftermath so was too busy to talk .

I do n't know when she 'll have or use internet access in the next couple of days , but for those folks wondering who they could wish well this week , you now have a target .

That poor girl has busted her ass fixing up her house and installing a new heater and wood stove for the last six months and probably longer .

I hope she is ok and the house is still livable in especially since she encountering very cold weather and considering where she lives and all .

Thank Dale for letting us know and please do tell her were thinking about her.:(

Personally , I think they should peg it to inflation so that the pension has the same general purchasing power over time , but I know that economically it would be a disaster as people are living more and more into their older years , far past when people would traditionally die .

The retirement age has not increased , but the amount of time on retirement has .

Eventually , the military will do away with retirement benefits , or at least certain aspects of them .

They use you and then discard you !

Sooner one understands that , one shall remain happy .

Army , you had me worried there for a minute as " they should peg it " means to die .

Service Pensions are " pegged " to inflation but usually capped to 2 %ish per annum , not much more .

Servicemen should be recieving..Service Pension and State pension and if they are lucky a Works pension .

The retirement age in the UK is due to rise in the future , at the moment retirement is 65 and Government wants to raise it to 70 .

I must say I also have little sympathy in this case .

Assuming h retired out of choice and was not wounded , then it really is your own responsibility to handle your finances in my opinion .

In the USMC you are required to attend the first day of a week long retirement seminar .

But your choice not your units .

Around the middle of the day , the leader of the seminar started asking us if we were coming back the next day .

About 70 % ( almost all combat arms guys ) said " No , We have things we need to do at our unit ."

He said you all spent at least 20 yrs doing things for the Corps . Now take a week for yourself and be informed before you retire .

If any of you think that someone from Headquarters Marine Corps care about you once they kick you out the door talk to a retiree .

No one from HQMC will call you to see how things are going .

No one will call you a month later to see if you have a job yet or if there is anything they can help you with .

The only thing I ever got from them was a " We want you to come back on active duty as a full time reservist ."

You will have to give up your retirement and disability payments .

Once we are done with you the retirement checks won't start again until your 65 since you will be considered a reservist .

The Corps needs you , do n't let us down ."

i think I let them down .

Aircraft dropped in an apparent decompression state with passengers on oxygen from 40K in a controlled dive .

Cause of the hole is unknown , aircraft is not old , being delivered in 1991 .

I 'm sure that it must have been alarming for all concerned .

and i have two clients who work for qantas , one a 747 long haul pilot , the other a aircraft engineer .

Let me open with a brief reminder ( or history lesson ) of one of the reasons I first started watching this show :

Oh , yeah , and " Five Questions " ( a wholy owned subsidiary of Craig Industries...)

Granted , a new host ( and granted the second clip was n't from the original " Daily Show ") but this is a news show ?

I 'd put in the Biden clip , only ' twasn't to be found on the intar @-@ tubes... How droll...

Anyhow , when did the " Daily Show " become such an institution of news that sitting heads of state would appear on such a thing ?

I guess it got gravity when lots of young kids starting watching .

But you have to realize , Obama went on Leno , Bill Clinton and Madeline Albright have been on the Daily Show , and every Democratic candidate for governor went on the Colbert Report .

The daily show is fun and very successful .

Jon Stewart has a great job...he can give absolute free range to his opinions without any restrictions that the regular news show have .

It 's no more a news show than O'Riley , Beck , Olberman etc.

it 's a comedy show that has some commentary , Stewart would be the last one to say it 's news .

If anyone is using this a real source of news , they need to get out more .

But still , he makes me laugh and most of the time I think he has good points to be considered .

I know this clip is older , but I think he hits the nail on the head regarding most of the commentary shows .

it 's supposedly news satire , though amusingly it 's almost just as informative if not more than the actual news shows running these days .

Obviously Stewart has some political message of his own thrown in .

Similar shows appear in other countries as people get sick of how every news talk show end up being either a pure propaganda 's machine for one particular side or a bickering debate that does n't make sense to anyone .

Taiwan has a version , though it uses actors to cast as famous figures ( started mostly with political figures , but eventually ended up with pretty much all sorts of famous figures ) and they pretend to debate on a serious topic .

How do you feel about the FCC getting their hands on the internet ?

do you want your internet censored ?

Just read the actual law and the analysis .

The first rule of lawmaking is give the bill a name that is exactly the opposite of what it really does .

Do you believe it to be enough of a threat that necessitates the US to take more action to do something about it , and if so , what action should that be ? ( e.g . border fence/wall , training for the Mexican police/military , monetary aid to the Mexican government , etc.)

The drug violence in Mexico started when the Mexican president decided to " get tough " on the drug cartels .

Fighting a war you can n't win is not noble .

Stop fighting the war on drugs and the violence will go down .

We need to get the government out of the prohibition game once and for all .

Legalize it , regulate it , and control it ( and tax it , too ! ) .

Once drug dealing ( AKA beer , wine , and liquor sales ) became legal and regulated , murders in America dropped dramatically .

Plus we stopped locking people up because they wanted to get drunk .

Recently i learned about Obama 's service plan , yeah may be late but better than never , and this is bothering me .

To add this his Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel has confirmed on 10 th Nov to draft a plan in this regard .

Though if it were , I see zero reason to limit it to college students age 18 - 25. If it 's required it 's nothing more than a civil service draft , slavery .

Might as well be forcing ' em to work the cotton...

IMO its a fair price to pay .

This coming from someone that footed their own college tuition , No mommy and daddy allowences , no grants or anything else .

And it will keep them out of trouble and teach them some things as well .

Here in New Zealand everyone is taught how to cope and survive for up to at least three days without assistance from outside .

I 'm sure the Russians want to gauge his reaction .

I cannot help but recall the age old expression that Youth and Enthusiasim is no match against Wisdom and Treachery .

Obama got some clout as being the President Elect of the US but I shudder when he goes up against Putin .

Obama will have to do something over the top like the four previous Presidents before him did .

This savagery seems to be a requirement to prove one has the mettle to be " tough ."

Nevermind that really being tough is working out a solution that does n't require bloodshed .

As far Obama is concern , I would rather wait for his cabinet appointees...

To make bold predictions on what Obama will do as president or what he will fail to do as president , one must wait to see who are the all the players .

probably not , and probably George Tennent would have still be running the war in Afghanistan as least had some influence there .

Then , you are consistent with your views , and there is merit in that .

I gave you an explanation as to why he did what he did ( in part thanks to us ) .

How does that go I want to know ?

DO NOT make him mad ! !",

or " Theres a secret to get this door locked , see you have to push on the door while pulling upward ."

Can they decorate HOWEVER they want ?

Lets say Barack wants teal shag carpeting in the oval office....can he do that ?

Could Michelle have the hallways painted neon orange if she wanted ?

Do the kids get to pick their own rooms ?

Will they have to share a bathroom ?

Will they have to use a computer in the main living area so they are not accessing naughty things on the internet ?

Could the Obamas even access porn on the internet if they wanted ?

Can the secret service hear things from the outside of the doors they are guarding ?

Can they just fire them at will and have a new one sent over ?

Could they keep a pet giraffe on the grounds if they wanted to ?

If they wanted to get rid of the bowling alley and put in a discoteque could they do it ?

Do they have to put a " Do Not Disturb " sign on their bedroom door , or can they just lock it when they want some undisturbed time ?

And does the secret service knock and wait for an answer or just go charging into the bedrooms/bathrooms .

I think this shows that pretty much every President can do any design thing they want with both the Residence and the Office Wings

I too would love to know the answers .

Not that I am complaining ; thats my tax dollars that 's funding those lavender curtains

Surely this is not the time to write down your won candidate

Also , I do n't agree with the tone of the article that McCain 's principled positions are costing his this election .

Do you think far right parties like the BNP in the UK should be accepted as representing a decent part of society or should they be viewed as hate filled bigots ?

Do far right parties deserve more respect or will they always be seen as bigots .

In order to afford to stay in inner city LONDON , a person , probably along with his family , has to have a monthly income that supports this .

In order to do that a ethnic , has to have a stable job and thus already proving himself worthy . / rant over .

Generally speaking the working @-@ class in a nation have negative views of immigrants because they 're at the economic margins and view immigrants as competition for scarce opportunities .

I do n't see anything wrong with the long @-@ term concerns on immigration that many in the UK may hold , but reform can be carried out through the mainstream parties in Britain without having to resort to a racist @/@ fascist party .

If you 're concerned about immigration from the EU , then withdraw from the EU .

It may have moderated its tune , but that 's what it is at its core .

I do remember Maggie flying out and pulling every string she could to get him this . Considering Du Toit got 32 years and Mann won't see much less she saved his life .

thank god for the French

we have all seen the stereotypes the Frenchman defeated by germans in war ungrateful to the heroic american who had their back in WW2 or the snobby french people whole ignore tourists who speak english

france maybe a white European ex @-@ colonial western democracy but by no means are they right behind america or britain

and i dont think the french will be demanding that the chinese govt suppress the demonstrations we have heard of in china

after all the chinese people are doing what tibetan monks and exiles were fighting for to do in tibet - freedom to protest

You know there is one job I DO N'T want this summer and that is the HCIC Security of the Olympics .

Rumour is now that Western visitors are planning to protest during the Olympics and considering the reaction today , we can expect a hell of a lot of kung fu .

If they stopped buying American DVDs it would only mean LICENSED ones .

GO on EbaY they even sell the knock offs to us .

I think those ok with the chinese police state are really ok with the $ to be made there and they were never concerned about freedom only the spread of market capitalism .

The Chinese were brilliant in adopting large scale no regulation market capitalism thereby co @-@ opting so many Americans who place capitalism and profit motive above a belief in democracy and freedom .

We really need to get out of bed with tyranny if we support freedom in the US

Or rather they do n't know how to use it .

The number of posters here touting how good the Tibetans have it is testament to that .

They are in their little village .

but you still have to study and go to Beijing 1 st .

If you 're stuck in your village , you 're SOL .

The other major problem is that because that very few Chinese citizens who are knowledgeable enough to challenge the municipal governments are nowhere near the Tibetans .

Even if the Tibetans want to sue , they do n't know how and that opens up to corruption and abuse since they know the Tibetans won't take them to court over it .

I will be attending a meeting with the Veterans Day Parade committee .

We have a Parade on or about Veterans Day in November down Atlantic Avenue in North Long Beach .

We have been doing this for several years now and have had many varied entrants including Mexican prancer horses , re @-@ enactors in various uniforms ( including WW I and WW II German ) , Cavalry units of various countries ( the WW II German cavalry " man " was actually a pretty girl using the helmet to hide her hair ) .

We had a problem last year in that a Gay Pride group wanted to be part of our parade but we kept them out with the excuse that they only suddenly showed up and did not apply to be a unit .

This year we are being " asked " to include an Anti @-@ War unit in the parade made up mostly of people protesting the war in Iraq .

Besides the initial mistrust of " not believeing " they will not disrupt the parade , unless they are willing to sign a document stating they will honour the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice , and give thanks to the ones who are currently fighting to ensure they " can have an opinion " and not in anyway disrupt the parade....then I would say no they cannot join the parade.......

If they will sign said socument then welcome to the parade .

I would guess both groups want to politicise the event , which is after all to honour veterans , not make a political statement .

If they want a political rally , they can organise their own ,

if they want to participate as veterans then nobody 's stopping them from parading with their units .

If they are n't vets , it 's not their right to parade .

With the troubles in the world economy , and the pound rapidly losing value against the euro , is it time for the UK to adopt the euro ?

What are the advantages of Britain adopting the euro , and what are the disadvantages ?

It 'll cost a lot to do it which would not be advisable at the current time with the economic situation not looking rosy ,

So even if it made sense it would be political suicide to try and do it .

I just can n't imagine sitting in a restraunt and ordering a human steak !

What do you think about this article/ if the url works... Let me know .

Hell , I 'd try anything once , but if I change my mind , bet Andrew Zimmer would be right there with a fork and a knife !

On this the 70 th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor , we remember all those that are still entombed there and their shipmates !

The Japanese are observing this day as well by telling everyone that it never happened or we made them attack us because we would n't give them things .

If you ever get the chance to to watch the documentary about Nanking and the other Japanese atrocities during WWII you will be shocked to find a picture taken of a Japanese private bayoneting a civilian and the interview with that very private saying he did n't do it as do many of the Japanese soldiers who did things like this .

The Carrier JFK CV67 was due to arrive yesterday however she was held off an additional day due to high winds in the area and will arrive today at the Inactive Ships Reserve at the former PNSY where she will reside for the next two years in mothballs .

Now it is only a matter of time before Kitty retires and brings to an end the era of steam powered CV 's in the USN .

They need to sell her for scrap and get rid of that floating wreck .

Why waste money maintaining a ship that was in such bad shape , she could n't conduct air ops before they decommissioned her ?

As more and more ships are built , the scrappers have more and more ships to scrap .

When you go to a store to buy a new shiny mop bucket , you feel happy to do so .

You feel lucky when you receive a new shiny roll of pennies from the bank , you frown when its the old rusty roll of pennies .

When you discard the rusty old mop bucket , you do n't feel sorry to do so . Its people oriented too .

Since carriers costs so much , they are kept in service longer .

You would n't think of buying a television without remote control today .

They are so old , they do n't make them any more .

With the carriers , they received their mid @-@ life refits upgrading their electronics and electrical motors .

They have also received their service life extension programs too , upgrading or replacing their larger machinery components .

Interesting in that the USN is planning to prematurely decommission its MHC 51 Osprey class mine @-@ hunting ships .

As regards amphibious ships the USN wants desperately to decommission its steam @-@ powered LHA 1 Tarawa class ( LHA 3 Belleau Wood will actually be decommissioned this fall ) .

These ships will soon start turning thirty years old with no SLEP being undertaken .

It is also said they have aged much quicker than anticipated .

The USN poured a ton of money into the LPD 4 Austin class ships to keep them going for 40 years ( in some cases it will be 40 plus ) w/o a SLEP .

They dont want to repeat the experience .

Also the LPD 17 San Antonio class will be trucated at eight ships IMHO( some say seven others nine and nine have already been named ) .

Selling two LHA 1 class ( Plus granting two others as spares hulks ) and four LSD 41 class ships to India is intriguing IMHO .

With the demise of the Battleships almost a certainty and only a handful , if any , of the DDX class ships to be built( Plus the truncated LPD program ) the USN is poised to cut its amphibious forces by 1 @/@ 3 .

it is a good start because it adds a whole dimension to the INdian armed forces....

yeah , but i dont think it make that much of a difference...since we already have plenty of large landing ships...which we can manufacture indiginously if necessary .

It is a very old decrepit ship that needs a huge major overhaul to bring it up to today 's standards .

IN would be better off buying a new ship with that kind of money .

AT LEAST IT WILL GET A CHEAP SHIP FOR DOING MOSTLY HUMANETERIAN WORK .

AND THIS IS THE ONLY REASON THAT AMERICANS HAVE SUDDENLY AGREED TO SUPPLY INDIA THIS PARTICULAR SHIP .

Ive been in many and hated every second of it .

I got derided and laughed at alot for the seemingly overcaustiousness I ALWAYS undertook .

I preferred not to die thisway.:

We were always taught in First Aid @/@ Rescue never to enter a tank if there was someone unconsious inside...

I read a story relating to the cleaner Trychlrothylene used to clean a tank in the RN back inthe 70 s , the guy was around it too long that his mylenin ( the fatty cover around the spine ) was eaten away by it and he went bonkers for a few hours and then died .

Hell you have to take alot of caution when you are working in closed areas with noxious fumes , even building models you can get messed up off the paints if you dont have an open window .

Yanks out , bombers in , 12 bombs , dozens killed , control battle starts , sunnis v shites , millions of dollars @/@ pounds spent , lives lost , FOR WHAT , for sweet fuck all that 's what ,

Iraqi forces have no chance of controlling ,

Iraq is gonna get worse now than before the west tried to make it better

lets get out of AG as well leave the village tribal idiots to it .

If push comes to shove , slash n burn , waste no more lives n cash on useless campaign 's . IMO

IMO , The Iraqi 's screwed themselves by giving into the Sadrists and others .

As mentioned before the US should have punched his ticket and his army of idots before departing Iraq .

Once again politics interviened and spared their sorry ass .

This is what they get in return for that stupid decision .

The large " gray area " knows no boundries . And once you let religion into politics instead of keeping them seperate the black and white disappears depending upon who you are and only gray exists .

And it does create innumerable problems for the govt which has to maintain its aim and deliver .

That the troops are still managing speaks very highly of their dedication and patriotism and they should be commended .

All said and done , a difficult situation indeed , but the national aim cannot be forsaken !

I 'm around CENTCOM 's warriors all day every day , and I can tell you that they do n't seem tired and worn out to ME .

But if only one third of the troops like the way we 're going about the business of winning in Iraq , that does NOT necessarily mean they 've lost faith in the mission .

But that does n't mean I do n't believe in the mission .

Far from it - I want to go at the job HARDER . I want to WIN .

I want the surge to be BIGGER , SOONER , and to last as long as it takes to WIN .

So , although it 's only my perspective here and backed by absolutely no numbers , stats or facts other than what I know from personal observation , I simply do not see the impending crash coming .

What I can tell you that I do see is a frustrated will to victory , and a sense that our leaders and People are not as committed as we are .

Bluesman , This repeated turnover and its effect I understand to some degree since we ( Indian Army Infantry units ) are always back in the CI grid after every two years .

If we were sent without this break , I am sure we would have got really fed up .

As it is , we have started having problems inspite of this two year layover in peace stations , since the standard of living has gone up and our troops are getting urbanised and soft .

We also have the advantage that we are from the same unit for life in most cases and so the cohesiveness is more and we know each other well .

You 'd have to work around them to truly understand what I mean .

Otherwise , I just do n't think you 'd really be able to see it the way I do .

In my job , I work with ALL the inter @-@ agency players , and I NEVER experience the kind of inertia and drag with anybody else .

This is absolutely the truth : the State Department wonks down here do not want to be associated with the word ' kill ', as in my branch 's mission of ' capture or kill enemy high @-@ value individuals '.

That 's what we attempt to do ; that 's what they want no part of .

And you 'd have to be here to know what it is to be frustrated and impeded by people that vehemently object to your very existence .

I wish I could express it in a way that you would know what I mean .

bluesman , i have n't worked inter @-@ agency , so i trust you know best .

however , in their defense , i would like to mention that

1. the pinstripers have n't been exactly beloved or respected by the bush administration .

some of this is fair ( state was all but ignored in 2003 ) , some of this is not ( bureaucratic irritation at the initiatives kicking them out of comfortable perches and into WoT hotspots ) .

2. CIA has got plenty of ex @-@ military , and there 's enormous pressure to get more .

i trust that i break no state secrets by telling you that if you head over to langley , you will see a lot of twenty @-@ somethings and lots of fifty @-@ year old senior staff , and not much in between . the lack of a middle is really making ' em push for ex @-@ military to fill that .

i can assure you that patriotism is high up on their values , more so than ever .

I 'll try to explain my perspective on all this .

I was for the war , still am if it could be fought properly , but it can n't be .

Bush 's goal is a secure Iraq , with a functioning gov't that can police the country and be an American ally in the War On Terror .

My knowledge is all second hand , but that 's all I have to go on .

Did anyone ever bother to ask WHY Saddam did the things he was hung for ?

These people need a dictator who 's willing to use mass murder when they step out of line .

Unfortunately we are n't prepared to use similar tactics , so this war is unwinnable .

If it was up to me , everytime an IED goes off we 'd get our people out , draw a circle on a map with at least a 500m radius around the point of the blast , and turn that area into a smoking crater .

Do that a few times and these " people " might start to behave better .

We can surge troops all we want , but if the level of cruelty does n't increase it will all be pointless .

I can n't believe I was stupid enough to buy all the tripe about what Iraq could become if we just remove the dictator .

I also have some problems with Bush that I did n't have when I voted for him , based on his piss poor performance .

He 's recently changed policy to go after the Iranian agents that are supplying the militias .

WHY DID N'T WE WHACK THEM AS SOON AS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED ? ??

How many Americans are dead or maimed because Bush was playing some diplomatic footsy game with Iran ?

There are two of our Border Agents in prison for doing their jobs , and twelve Marines sitting in jail in San Diego for hitting the wrong house after they were attacked in Haditha .

Bush has n't lifted a finger to help either of those groups of men , and that 's why IMO Bush has shown himself to be nothing but an honorless pig .

Can someone talk me out of this ?

The big change is that the insurgents have decided to rely on IEDs rather than ambushes with shoulder @-@ fired weapons to kill the two or three GIs per day they figure they need to wear down the US public 's will to stay in the fight . And it 's working , way too well .

The stats are clear : IED victims make up a bigger chunk of our casualties every month . Over the last six months , IEDs have caused 63 % of US combat deaths . Last month ( October 2005 ) was typical : out of 96 US troops killed , IEDs were responsible for 57 .

Compare that with April 2004 , a terrible month when we lost 140 troops . Back then the insurgents relied on RPGs and small arms . Only 19 of our 140 KIA that month @-@ barely more than a tenth @-@ were killed by IEDs .

The insurgents have decided to do it the easy way . As long as they can use IEDs , their low @-@ tech standoff weapon , why should they risk close combat ?

The real question is why they can get away with it . And here @-@ well , I hate to keep saying this , but somebody needs to . The reason they can do it is because we still have NO INTEL on them . It 's the biggest failure of the war , and nobody talks about it . CI warfare is about people , not hardware . We 're all hardware and no intelligence , like a Tim Allen show . Makes me sick .

That makes the decision to go with IEDs a no @-@ brainer for the insurgents . In the standard ambush , the kind we were facing a year ago , the insurgents detonated an IED under a convoy , then opened up on the stalled survivors with RPG and small arms fire . It probably made them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire was ineffective and by concentrating their forces , the insurgents made themselves vulnerable to our air power .

The problem in any guerrilla battle is the getaway . Anybody can pull a trigger ; the trick is getting your men home safe , while enemy choppers zoom through the sky and every street is full of troops and armor looking for men of military age . That 's the tough part .

An IED ambush has none of those risks . Only one man needs to be on the spot @-@ the triggerman . He detonates the IED from a car parked down a side street and drives away before the occupiers can even start their search . No risk . No casualties . Very demoralizing for the occupiers , especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood was in on the attack but they can n't level the locals ' shacks like they 're dying to .

What makes this wave of IEDs worse is that the devices are getting more effective . Frankly I 've been shocked at how good the Iraqis are with these things right from the start . I mean , after that shameful performance in GW I , did you expect these bastards to be so sneaky , patient , and smart ? I knew this war was a bad idea , but even I never realized what we 'd be up against .

The scariest tech development of all is that the insurgents have learned how to make shaped @-@ charged IEDs . To understand why shaped charges are such a powerful weapon , we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physics . I love this stuff . I mean , what red @-@ blooded American boy did n't experiment with explosives ? The only reason I ever opened my Chem book was to see if it mentioned TNT or dynamite in the index . ( It did n't @-@ goddamn hippie teachers.) And naturally I used the local wildlife , like toads and bees , in my experiments with the killing power of firecrackers .

What I learned was the most important point about the subject : blast alone does n't do a good job of killing the target . A bee would wobble off unhurt after one of my 4 th of July daisycutters went off right next to it .

Now before you hotheads whose hobby is making pipe bombs in the garage write me angry letters ( or send me long round packages with no return address ) , I know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast . We had a really nasty example of that in August this year , when a huge IED killed 14 Marines near Haditha . From what I 've read , investigation showed there was nothing special about the IED . It was just three anti @-@ tank mines stacked in a pile @-@ the IHOP of IEDs , I guess you could call it .

That ambush showed real clearly how important intelligence is in guerrilla warfare . The same unit that suffered the IED attack had just had six of its snipers killed in a small @-@ arms ambush . Now you tell me how anybody can ambush six snipers unless they 've completely penetrated the unit . The insurgents knew where the unit 's snipers would assemble , and they knew where the vehicle would be passing . We do n't know a thing about the enemy , but it 's clear that he knows way too much about us .

The other problem is that the 14 Marines were riding in one of those ridiculous landing crafts the Corps uses as APCs @-@ in Haditha , hundreds of clicks from the sea ! It 's called the AAV @-@ 7A1 , and it looks like a giant armored dinghy . Since it was designed to ferry troops ashore , it sacrifices armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that has no use anymore . But that 's the Corps for you . Real brave , but not always real smart .

Maybe if those guys had been in a real APC some would have survived . I can n't say . If the blast is big enough , it can kill even an MBT . The Pals took out two Israeli Merkavas , the best @-@ armored tanks in the world , with simple blast IEDs .

But most of the time , guerrillas do n't have the delivery systems to depend on blast power . If they 're trying to kill soft targets @-@ i.e . people @-@ they pack the bomb with homemade shrapnel : roofing nails , ball bearings , anything that 'll shred flesh . A suicide vest tipped with nails is basically a 360 @-@ degree 12 gauge .

To kill GIs that way , you need to catch them off @-@ guard , somewhere they feel safe . That 's what happened when a Jihadi killed more than a dozen of our guys in a mess hall in Mosul while they were having lunch -- minus their body armor .

In the field , US troops are a hard kill , especially because they move in armored convoys protected by choppers . And that 's the real beauty of IED attacks for a guerrilla : they absolutely nullify US air power . There are literally no targets for the attack choppers . The pilots know damn well that one of those Iraqi cars driving away from the scene is carrying the guy who set off the IED , but there 's no way to tell which one .

Those early IEDs were usually just shells buried by the road , wired up to a detonator . Lots of amateurs were tinkering in their garages , or whatever Iraqis have instead of garages , playing with stuff that goes boom . And naturally lots of those guys went boom themselves .

Like I said , war teaches people fast , but some of the lessons have to be learned by the next of kin , not the handyman whose bright idea for a new type of bomb turned him into an abstract painting all over his wall .

Sometimes an insurgency has to learn its lessons several times . Take the case of pressure @-@ triggered IEDs . These are basically standard anti @-@ vehicle mines , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . People and cars can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( meaning armored ) vehicle rolls over that scale , the bomb goes off . ( Trucks are a problem . Some trucks weigh as much as an APC.) The best part is that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . You can all be off at the hookah parlor polishing up your alibis when it goes off .

The insurgents in Baqouba used pressure bombs in 2003 , but they usually failed to go off . Their bombmakers did n't have the technique yet .

Thanks to info @-@ sharing , the internet gives an insurgency , they 're back at it , with better wiring diagrams . A week ago ( Oct . 24 ' 05 ) , a pressure bomb shredded a Humvee in Baqouba , tearing four GIs legs to pieces .

The first IEDs were mostly mortar rounds that failed against our armor . So the insurgents went to big 155 mm rounds . That 's a big , big shell and when you trigger it at the right moment , it 's going to kill almost anything but an M1 .

The M1 is a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgents have managed to knock out . As usual , the invasion was the easy part and the occupation was when things got lethal . We only lost 18 M1s in the conventional fighting , but the guerrillas have since managed to disable 80. Now most of those are track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action .

The good news is that the M1 has lived up to its rep for crew protection . The Army 's Armor Center says only five crew have died in IED attacks on M1s . ( Ten other M1 crew have been killed , mostly by sniper fire , riding in open hatches.)

So if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal is to find a way to kill M1s . Not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . And that 's where the shaped @-@ charge IED comes in . Shaped charges were developed for tank killing , used in MBT anti @-@ armor rounds and antitank weapons . Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal . Metals with low melting points , usually copper . The bomb @-@ maker 's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible . So sometimes he 'll put several 155 mm shells beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of TNT under it .

When the IED detonates , this copper cup turns into a shaft of superheated metal that can zip right through any armor , even an M1 's . That 's what they tell me , and I have to believe it .

It 's the kind of weird science that used to frustrate me in Physics , the sort of info you just have to take on faith . I can n't help wondering if they 're kidding us civvies about it all . I do n't get why a soft metal like copper can penetrate Chobham armor , which can defeat almost any warhead around .

Apparently the copper is n't even actually molten . It ejects as a solid ; it just " behaves like molten metal." I 'm sure the insurgent Home Improvement tinkerers do n't understand the science involved any more than I do . They just hear that it works and try it out .

Iran ? Maybe . Syria ? No way . Syria 's scared to death , ready to do anything to make Uncle Sam happy . And if it is Iran , what can we do about it ? There are still a few neocons so totally out of their little gourds they want us to invade Iran . I have to wonder if they 're agents of Dr Evil , programmed to destroy America . Because invading Iran would do it , it 'd end us once and for all .

This blame stuff is a sign of frustration . Nobody knows how to stop IEDs , even with all the Popular Mechanics geeks sending in their garage @-@ tech brainstorms . That 's because @-@ damn , how many times do I have to repeat it ? -guerrilla war has no technical solution . Or even military solution . The only effective CI techniques are torture , reprisal and , ultimately , genocide .

My guess is that genocide will come back one day . That was how the Ancients dealt with rebellious towns : wiped ' em out . One of these days some first @-@ world country is going to get impatient and a problem child like the Sunni Triangle will be a big , radioactive ghost town .

If we do n't do it , the Kurds may end up doing it the old @-@ fashioned way they learned from the Turks : one bullet , one village at a time . It 's been done before -- seen any Armenians up there lately ? Probably not , but most of " Kurdistan " used to be " Armenia." A few of the Armenians made it to Fresno , but the rest are buried up there .

We 're talking about Mesopotamia here , the place where war was invented . Hundreds of peoples have been wiped out forever in those parts . All these Holocaust lobbyists get furious if anybody says Jews are n't the only tribe to get genocided , but that 's just politics-" Our genocide is better than your genocide ! "

Sorry , as I stated , I did n't have much time , but the wife now has the newborn .

1. It 's not CI ( counter @-@ intelligence ) . CI is when you thwart your enemy 's intel operations . Thus , gaining intel on when @/@ where the insurgents are planting IEDs is intel , not counter @-@ intel .

2. Iraqis do n't have garages at their houses . Thus , I would conclude that this guy has never stepped foot in Iraq .

1. The Marine 's AAV is as armored as the standard Army APC - the M113. It sounds as if this pundit is probably a former Army guy . Based on the damage to the single AAV that was involved , unless it were a M @-@ 1 , more armor would n't have helped . That 's how big the IEDs are getting .

2. A single 155 mm round does n't do any significant damage to US armored vehicles ( the up @-@ armored HMMWV is n't a true armored vehicle in the sense that it was designed from the ground up with armor in mind - it was modified from a cargo vehicle ) . For example , on the Stryker , a 155 mm round will scratch some paint off and flatten tires .

3. War is like a sport . It is interactive and tactics , techniques , and procedures evolve continuously in reaction to your opponent . Back to the sports analogy , if you 're getting killed in a zone defense , you switch to man @-@ to @-@ man , etc. He seems to apply a template that the enemies of the US should be dumb and not react . Underestimating your enemy is a bad and dumb thing to do .

4. He fails to mention the intel that we get that allows us to defuse the majority of IEDs before they are detonated .

5. He fails to mention how switching back to wired devices makes it easier to catch the trigger man .

6. He fails to mention how using larger devices means that you need to spend more time preparing the site , which means a greater chance of compromise .

7. He complains about intel , but then advocates harsh techniques that run contrary to the values of the US and does n't weigh the impact that these techniques would have on gaining intel from the population and @/@ or bringing the population off the fence and to our side . His recommendations would result is less intelligence - gaining some information from a paid triggerman may result in a few short @-@ term successes within a particular cell , but it will alienate the population and result is less intel over the long @-@ run from the population and future cells that would be created down the road due the increased perception of occupation through the harsh techniques he advocates . As an example , Abu Ghraib , which was the direct result of a half @-@ dozen irresponsible individuals that were able to conduct their abuses due to the lacking leadership of their supervisors , had a huge negative impact on our relations with local Iraqis . The trust we had built with many was eroded and our ability to gain trust with others was much more challenging .

Bottomline , he does n't truly analyze the situation from all aspects and uses some faulty assumptions and some facts that are flat out wrong . In the end , you have the action @-@ reaction @-@ counteraction cycle that is producing bigger IEDs that are easier to catch , but more deadly if you do n't catch it . I 'm not stating that it 's not a problem , but this analysis does n't offer much value .

I hope this helps . As far approaches to COIN , I 'm sure that Ray , Lemontree , Dave Angel , and some of the others on this board whose militaries have been doing COIN for much longer than the US ( which , BTW has done COIN quite frequently , but then shuns it as a freak occurance and does n't internalize the lessons learned in favor on focusing on the " big threat ") can comment at length on why this article espouses the wrong approach to the problem .

I 'm just wondering what Indian posters think your government 's reaction would be if Australia asked for finished nuclear weapons and missiles , plus nuclear know how , with you for under the table shipments of yellowcake for your nuclear weapons program ?

You see , I 'm hoping that one day befor it is too late that Australia will wake up to the fact that we can n't rely on the US to be willing to lose a city over us by holding true on the ' nuclear umbrella ', if ever we had a conflict with China .

By shipping you yellowcake from say a secret source on defence land acqured for ' training ', we could keep it outside the NPT inspection treaty process so you can build bombs with it .

We ould even fly in vetted Indian miners ( with training ) to avoid the secret getting out here . It would benefit us by allowing payments to be made outside our budget approprations process , which is transparent .

Once we have our missiles we can announce that we are joining you in the non @-@ aligned movement , transport weapons grade uranium between us openly and generally ignore all the complaints it would generate and other peoples wars , just like you do now .

Involving outsiders usually increases the amount of headaches you have to deal with .

IMO , Every " first world " - technologically modern nation could probably do it today - some have chosen not to ( like Japan and Germany ) perhaps because of history ?

I think Australia probably could do it if they wanted too , and the rest of the world would n't object as much as they would if one of the historically agressive non @-@ nuclear nations did it .

A lot of the nuclear weapons tech that was unattainabe 20 @-@ 30 years ago is attaintable now . It would be very expensive , and there would be consequences .

The only reasons we would were if we really needed the money or if the yellowcake were not available elsewhere or if you were the only ones who had something we really needed from an existential perspective as barter .

It could and would probably work if India were to place their own nukes under Indian control onto Australian soil .

For your defense and our own .

But then you have that option already with the US , so the fact that you ask this question probably points to a drift in confidence or the fact that you feel you would be able to better control an Indian nuke umbrella to your prime advantage versus a US one .

Tired of the ever @-@ hulking , always @-@ advancing glacier of DVD and BD cases in my living room , I 've procured a media server and a Boxee box to run it .

My plan is to migrate all of my media ( probably about 700 DVDs and BDs , counting all the TV shows I have ) onto the server over the next year or so , and banish the hardcopy to a closet for backup .

So far I 'm getting great quality playback from some items , but real movies that I 've ripped are not great .

I 've played with a few different programs , but I like DVDFab the most so far .

Does anyone know if it 's really a " bit - to - bit clone ", or am I getting some default compression even if I 've set that to 0 % ? -@ dale

If there 's a visible difference between the DVD and the copy then it 's being compressed .

Sometimes the format you decide to convert it to has issues .

I seldom do it so I 'm not really au fait with what is good but the software I use is Handbrake and convert it to either.mov files or uncompressed mpeg4

I am thinking of implementing a rather lower cost option .

Manually rip all dvds to Mkvs , make a little htpc with a low cost amd llano cpu and a wireless card and hook it up to my TV .

COD 5 was a disappointment when they decided to go back to the same old world war 2 theme..

Just hope they dont overdo the middle @-@ eastern theme which they pulled off so well in COD4

how 'd they possibly pull @-@ off semi scifi without looking like a bad copy of Halo..

Plus I got what I wanted - an extension of modern warfare 1 instead of yet another World war 2 scenario .

Looks like they packed a lot more missions into COD 6 compared to COD 4 .

This is so much better than last year when I saw the COD 5 trailer ( Flamethrowers and all ) and all I could think of was - " Oh Dear..."

Since many of our troops are stuck in Iraq , it is likely that we may not have the resources to be able to send troops to Iran .

Although Israel has greater air and ground superiority then Iran , Iran has larger numbers of troops and have long range missles that can reach Israel .

Israel would find it hard enough to conduct air raids on Iran , let alone fighting a large scale war .

The distances are simply too great for Israel to be able to project much power against Iran .

Iran in retaliation would launch its long range missiles at Israel , as well as encouraging Hezbollah to harass Israel .

I think any Israeli action against Iran would involve bringing the US into the war , I think its the only way Israel can really do enough damage to make the whole effort worthwhile .

I have been searching for sometime now , and I can n't seem to find a dropshipper that sales merchandise low enough so I could profit from it .

You are going to have to find them on your own .

There are plenty out there but most of them are more trouble than they are worth .

There are also a very few that are good suppliers but you have to realize , when dropshipping , the profit margin is VERY thin and you have to be on top of them all the time , monitoring their inventory .

People find a dropshipper , sign up and then list , list , and list !

They list soooo much but then when it comes to monitoring the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory is still available .

You CAN have a successful business with dropshippers but it is W*O*R*K .

I found all my sources by surfing the net on my cellphone during commercials , while waiting in line , any spare moment .

And beware of " membership clubs " such as Doba and the like .

Real distributors do not charge you for taking your money .

Please do a quick search and you will find tons of info on drop shipping...here is a thread from the recent past http : //forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/Building @-@ An @-@ Ebay @/@ Using @-@ A @-@ Drop/5200052702?#msg5200760329

I cannot give you the formula for success , but I can give you the formula for failure -- which is : Try to please everybody . Herbert Bayard Swope

My partners and I refuse to use dropshipping .

If a dropshipper has 100 items for example and we sell 107 to 107 different people then we have 7 potential unhappy customers with the potential for 7 negative feedbacks .

A dropshipper is only concerned with selling their 100 items as fast as they can .

I am concerned with selling the 100 items that are in our inventory as best and correctly as possible .

OK...I know the answer to that but it still really bothers me .

This is what was waiting for me when I logged into facebook this afternoon

NO ! eBay should issue a coupon for buyers to use on our listings and get 15 % off....

we would still get our full $$ and eBay can give the seller the difference that the buyer saves !

Until someone else come along and challenge ebay they will keep on doing the same thing , but soon or later that will happen , , , .........I hope sooner

, ...,Most people do n't realize that the best answer are the one that they do n't want to hear . chan

yup..I knew the answer but still hate it !

Since I like wood working I thought some folks would enjoy an amplifier shell that they could finish themselves and either use it to restore an old Marshall amplifier or to collect aftermarket parts from countless other vendors and end up with a Vintage Marshall clone .

So , I have had pretty good luck selling these wooden amp head shells in the past and thought I would reintroduce my product .

Well , Ebay pulled my listing for having the word " Marshall " in the title .

I did a quick ebay search using " Marshall style " and came up with 100 's of listings that use that term for after market parts and kits .

I also searched another famous amplifier company and typed in " Fender style ".

And its clear that I did not claim it was an actual " Marshall " product which is why I put the word " style " in the listing .

People who are looking for these items won't find them without knowing that it is for a Marshall or Marshall style amp .

Can n't use the manufacturer 's name in the title unless the item being listed is actually made by the manufacturer .

Michael 's right - someone somewhere decided to report you , and you ended up getting a wrist @-@ slap .

You -@ could @- start reporting all the " style " listings you found and ( hopefully ) watch them go away .

Sometimes it only takes one report... sometimes you gotta stay on top of it for a while .

There are special rules for what you want to do , offering non @-@ brand replacement components ( in your case , the wood case ) .

Unfortunately , I just do n't recall what they all are...

there 's a way to word the description that works and does n't get you slapped for " keyword spamming " ( which is what putting Marshall in the descriptive text will earn you ) .

as long as it does n't fall into the NOT ALLOWED category by meeting this criteria :

Using " compatible with , " " fits , " or " for " before a brand name in the title of your listing to describe items that are universally compatible or that are compatible with an entire product class

Just know if it is someone that is " after you " ( which sometimes happens ) - there is ALWAYS some violation that you are breaking or you are near the questionable portion of breaking some policy .

Because eBay will usually " pull first ask later " when a listing is reported , your listings will only become better and you may just sell more because of what you learn on how to become a better seller as you refine your listings .

If you keep a good sense of humor and communicate with eBay... eBay will start " ask first pull later ".

I wonder if someone can clear something up for me ?

Now , this was originally taken out as interest only but when I 've phoned a couple of years ago to increase the payment they have changed it to " part interest , part repayment ". Not too fussed about this as I 've worked out the numbers and the correct amount is coming off the capital every month .

I 'm going to contact Halifax for details on how to make overpayments as I 've increased my direct debit again but would like to be able to make ad @-@ hoc overpayments when I 'm able to .

Thing I 'm curious about is the 10 % overpayment thing - I know my mortgage agreement is subject to this however what does it really mean ? Should I only be paying 10 % more than my interest only payments or is it 10 % extra off the capital ? My new direct debit ( as of end Dec 12 would take me over the 10 % of IO payments ) .

I 'm guessing they will give me a rough idea of how much I can overpay in £s based on my current direct debit but would be interested to know beforehand just for my knowledge .

Currently Halifax have on their records that " Pensions " will be paying the capital off at the end of the term - these are currently non existent so trying to get myself at least on track for repayment at the end of term .

its 10 % of the mortgage balance for the year , so if your mortgage balance in £100,000 that year you can overpay by £10,000 during the course of the year without penalty .

However , if you are on the SVR you dont have the 10 % limit , just overpay as much as you can comfortably afford

Are you sure you 're on SVR ? Or just a rate that is soon to end ?

Having worked for Halifax it is indeed correct that once you 've reached the SVR then no overpayment limits are enforced you are simply free to overpay as much as you wish to .

This is correct . Your KFI @/@ Mortgage Offer may say something along the lines of ' in any one year you may repay up to 10 % of the amount outstanding on your special rate product '. It 's a rolling 12 months , so the year starts when you make your 1 st overpayment . So , you could n't pay £10k in december and another £10k in january for instance , you 'd need to wait 12 months .

Hi , I 'm in the middle of a divorce and am trying to take on the mortgage on the family home .

I 'm only trying to borrow about 16 % of my home 's current market value , which is about twice my annual income .

Have approached several big lenders and tried going through a financial adviser , but noone will lend because my income is made up of : 4 very part @-@ time jobs ( 2 employed , 2 self @-@ employed ) , maintenance ( not yet Court ordered ) and tax credits .

Their argument is that once my daughter leaves school some of these income sources will cease , but by then I would hope to be back at work full time ( she 's only 7!).

The mortgage rates I 've been quoted are less than I 'm paying at the moment anyway !

It 's been suggested to me that I try and take out a personal loan instead ?

You would think that having 4 part time jobs that at least you will have 2 at any one time and that is more secure than having 1 full time job and possibly being given notice to leave .

It sounds like you are self employed and will need the assistance of an accountant to create some books that show some decent profit combining all the sources of income streams as one source of income .

They may be doing an affordability calculation instead of a income multiple and do n't think you can afford to pay for day to day living expenses and a mortgage .

Hi all , I currently have a mortgage which what used to be Northern Rock .

This is due to finish in June .

I do n't know what to do !

I took the mortgage out with my then husband , we split two years ago .

He did all the money side of things so have no idea where to go .

I have a funny feeling that since house prices have dropped , I am likely to be in negative equity .

If you are in negative equity as you seem to think , there is no prospect of another lender taking you on , so a remortgage is n't going to be possible .

NRAM @/@ UKAR which is the body managing your mortgage does not offer replacement or customer retention products , so your mortgage will revert to the follow @-@ on rate set out in your original Key Facts Illustration ( KFI ) or mortgage offer .

Say for instance they say it is better you ask for this provider but in fact , when you afollow their suggestion , you get rejected ?

Is not that it is better to sticj to your bak who knows wel your financial stability and ability ??

I undesratnd that some mortgage adviser are free of charge .

I am asking here because once you get rejected it will seriously danage your credibility to get another lender ?

Opinions and expereince from people in ths forum are really appreciated....

Obviously I am biased as I am an independant mortgage adviser but my view is it is good that we can source the whole market finding the best deals and knowing the specific lending criteria of each lender .

I used to work for a bank and I would never offer my services to my friends and family as I did n't know whether there were better services elsewhere .

Now I am comfortable doing things for my friends and family .

Banks will want you to think that you have a better chance of getting a mortgage with them as you have your finances with them but this is simply not true .

If you get rejected you need to look into the reasons why...affordability..credit score etc

Hi My husband and I are looking to buy the hosue we currently live in , but we do not have a deposit .

I currently earn about £21k a year and hubby earns just under £15k a year .

What is the likelyhood of us getting a mortgage to start off with and is going to be more difficult to find 100 % one ?

A shared ownership property is one where you do not buy the property outright , but only a percentage share of the property . For example only 25 % .

However on the remaining 75 % which is still owned by the housing association , you will pay a monthly rent .

So if you are not looking at this types of properties , you will not get a 100 % mortgage .

Hello all - just joined and after some advice .

I 've seen the posts on the forum relating to the Nationwide consent to let and subsequent hike in interest rates by 1.5 % ( this is going back a year or two ) .

At the time my wife and I were renting out our property and had signed up to a 5 year fixed rate mortgage .

We initially lived in the property but subsequently let it out having received permission to do so from Nationwide .

Given we were in a fixed rate mortgage and had paid for the extra security i was pretty shocked and appalled that they were forcing this increase on us .

In any case my wife went to Nationwide to discuss our options with the mortgage adviser .

The long and short of it is that the mortgage adviser gave the advice that given base rate was 0.5 % and we could move to another lender on a formal BTL mortgage for a far lower rate ( given with the 1.5 % increase our Nationwide rate would be over 7 %) and therefore over a the mortgage term more than cover the early repayment fee .

This advice made perfect sense so we paid to come out of our fixed rate with Nationwide and moved to another lender - the early repayment fee was circa £3k .

Subsequently we received the letter from Nationwide ( as I am sure many did ) saying that those on fixed rate mortgages that would have to pay early redemption fees would not have the 1.5 % increase imposed until the end of the term of the fixed rate .

Given the advice we received and subsequent redemption fee we paid ( prior to Nationwide changing their minds ) I wonder whether anyone thinks we have any recourse against Nationwide .

I would certainly go to the branch , speak to someone in management and present this letter along with any documentary evidence that you may have had from your previous meeting .

Also get them to produce the notes of your previous meeting with the mortgage adviser .

we came within a gnats whisker of paying a 7k early redemption fee to avoid the 1.5 % hike .

thankfully the letter arrived a day before our completion date on our new mortgage so we were able to get out of it .

only 15 months until we can leave nationwide and move over to a proper btl mortgage .

We need to borrow 55 % of the hammer price until we can get planning permission for restoration which will allow us to get a mortgage

( Excuse me while I do a little - this is a building we nearly bought through normal channels 5 years ago , got gazumped on and never thought we 'd ever get another crack at it ! )

It does n't seem likely and would be horrendously expensive .

Look at it from the lender 's point of view :

On the flip side there is little return for the lender as you do n't want the loan for long so not much time to charge interest .

Really you would be better off : Getting a mortgage not a bridging loan ( also difficult ) . Getting an unsecured loan to buy it initially .

Be aware that almost no bank or building society will give a mortgage on a property after it has been bought , if it was bought less than 6 months ago .

I do n't know the answer to your question , but it sounds very risky to me .

Does it know that the house is uninhabitable - usually that makes a property unmortgeable .

Or if the PP takes much longer to be considered because there are objections / it 's refused and you have to appeal etc ?

Last time we got a thread like this , I suggested Tiuta and the OP did some research and found the cost was prohibitive .

I echo the other comment about how you deal with being unable to remortgage if something goes wrong and would ask you to note you 'll have to stick with the bridging finance for around eight months as you won't be able to apply for the remortgage until you 've owned the property for six .

They cannot lend on a property you will be living in as this then falls into FSA regulation , which bridging is excluded from .

An alternate to bridging is a non status mortgage , but the lender will still need to survey the property and carry out the nusual due dilligence to include full legal conveyancing and checks .

The reason most aution deals are cash is that lending is NEVER guaranteed and can fall through at the mast moment , meaning the applicant looses the property and thier 10 % deposit .

You 'll need a good deal of luck to get this through using lending .

Also bridgers usualy want a clearly defined exit route , and it wont be sufficient to say a remortgage should be possible subject to all manner of property repairs ( what if you fall ill / go mad / get depressed part way into the renovation for example ) .

The property was valued at £102000 when we purchased it and we now owe £77000 .

I am interested in learning more about how valuations work when remortgaging .

Nothing much has changed since last valuation in or out the property .

To be honest I would be happy with £102000 valuation but guess we will find out .

Are you remortgaging to a new lender , or doing a product transfer with the current one ?

If you are moving your mortgage to a new lender , it will normally ask a surveyor to visit the property to establish its value .

As you are right on the 75 % borderline for the better products , I would imagine an inspection would be better for you .

Talk to your current lender before you start shopping around .

Why on earth would you allow somebody else to sort out payslips and P60 for you ?

If you had proof of income why not provide it ?

You have been complicit in any fraudulent application by allowing it to happen with full knowledge .

Struggling to see how you could compain to the lender and CAB when you applied fraudulently .

I suspect you are now registered as a fraudulent applicant and will struggle to gain finance anywhere .

If I apply , and the valuation comes out lower , I 'd have to pick the next best product , which is actually Santander .

Do I risk losing the £195?

I suppose only I can answer that , but any thoughts or tips ?

You appear to have done the maths and identified the pitfalls .

If there 's no way of avoiding that fee , you appear to have to risk it .

Is n't there a product with no fees you could choose upto 75 % so you 'd lose nothing if the property is downvalued ?

Lenders I have spoken to say that while their valuation fee is ' free ', you still have to pay for it but it is refunded if you go ahead .

I guess it 's not always the case ( only spoke to 2 lenders , and perhaps I only discussed it with one of them ) .

Was looking for a little advise in regards to the possible mis @-@ selling by a mortgage broker of a 100 % intrest only mortgage .

My partner signed up for a 100 % intrest only mortgage with the Nothern Rock mortgage but to realise it was a intrest only mortgage some 5 years down the line .

The reason I feel that may have a case to be answered is that surely mortgage company must take some precautions when selling an intrest only mortgage

i.e the customer must take out some sort of endowment to ensure that when the mortgage intrest is finally paid off then the customer would be in a financial position to pay of the actual amount the mortgage was agreed for ? ??

Read the paperwork she got when she took out the mortgage - it will explain that you need to set up a repayment vehicle for the capital amount .

Unfortunately this was quite a common problem , particularly with young first time buyers who have no real clue about mortgages .

This was a problem during the boom years in that banks were not checking if customers had a repayment vehicle in place , hence they were throwing these interest only mortgages at people because that 's all they could afford because house prices were so high .

Many people put a lot of faith in some of these brokers in the belief that they were acting in their best interests .

Unfortunately there is probably little come back because ultimately your partner should have read closely what she was getting into before she signed .

I know that might sound callous but there is the saying that covers this which is ' buyer beware '.

I would like to here from anyone who saw the last recession , late eighties , pan out and how the sectors reacted .

Except there is a good chance that commodities and commodity stocks will spike violently upwards for a while in a year or so ( higher than they were in 2008 ) , thanks to supply destruction which may well have a coiled spring effect .

Also inflation and a falling dollar should help them go up as well..

I am due to receive approx 20K from sale of deceased parental home and need to find somewhere to put it .

have used up my isa allowance ( so has hubby ) may need to access all our funds within the next 12 month as we will either be moving home or doing self build if nothing suitable comes on market .

therefore need to be able to access funds without too much penalty/notice .

Have 2 kids and wonder if i could put money in children accounts for better tax free interest or do you have any suggestions please ?

Based on what you have said , you should not invest but stick to savings .

If you put money into the name of your child it becomes his beneficially .

In any case see http : //www.hmrc.gov.uk/tdsi/children.htm for tax treatment of interest on money given to children by parents .

Hi An elderly relative ( late 80 s lives in annex adjoining the house ) has banked with lloyds all her life - and she asked me for some general advice .

I wasnt at all familiar with her financial situation and she has in the past been advised by Lloyds .

What appears to be the case is that she has : £150k+ in an OEIC @/@ shares ISA with Scottish Widows £30k in easy access savings account paying 2 % with lloyds £15k in current account with Lloyds £5k in cash ISA with lloyds

What struck me was that she has all her savings in Lloyds @/@ Scottish Widows so well over the £85k protection limit .

Also that she had been advised to put so much in OEIC @/@ corporate bonds/shares ISAs as it appears her capital has been fluctuating ( generally down ) .

She invested this whilst in her 80 s so am struggling to see how it would be good advice to ask her to put so much in a scheme where capital is not protected .

Anyhow we have booked an appointment next week to go through this with me in support .

My instinct is to get her into good savings accounts where capital is not at risk and to split it across 3 different institutions ( it seems you can can get 3 %+ if you keep an eye on the rates being offered ) , plus make sure she uses all the ISA allowance each year

Any thoughts @/@ commented would be appreciated ? David

I 'd be reluctant to start messing with an elderly relative 's finances .

That said : 1 ) If she 's of sound mind you need to understand if she 's prepared to move from LTSB or not .

2 ) If she wants to stay with LTSB , support her in finding the best home for her money from their range , but also help her to keep it in a good paying account , as most of their accounts have 12 month bonuses .

3 ) Make sure you do n't do anything with cash ISA that could impact her stocks and shares ISA .

4 ) Get her agreement to shift money from the current account to a better savings account ( even if it 's only the 2 % one ) .

My biggest concern for her would be if she owns a property .

As dunstonh suggests , the shares will effectively be in her name and are n't relevant to the protection scheme .

Banks generally will do what 's best for them which is invariably bad for the customers .

As mentioned though , change is never fun , especially when it could be confusing and misunderstood .

I would personally say she should find an IFA and pay upfront for advice ( ie no commissions ) so she gets what is most suitable for her .

Given her age it 's standard practice to have less money in equity and more in guaranteed income than she currently appears to have due to short term fluctuations .

I 'm probably going to get criticized for what I 'm about to write , but as a long time lurker on these forums I know that I can also expect some sensible and honest opinions .

I have been having a relationship with a married man for some time now and I 'm starting to get fed up with the situation and wonder if this is all it 's ever going to be .

How likely is it that a married man would leave his wife for the ' other woman ', How do I know if he 's serious about me or just toying with me ?

I know he does love me , but that 's not always enough is it ?

I am really torn at the moment whether to let things carry on , or to walk away .

Likelihood of him leaving his wife for you , slim to none .

Even if he does could you live your life happily ?

If he can do it to his wife , would he have qualms about doing it to his girlfriend ?

1. The person you are having the affair with is cheating on his wife .

If he does it once , he could do it again - remember the old saying " when a man marries his mistress , it leaves a vacancy - for the next mistress ".

There are all the excuses in the world " he will leave when the children are older @/@ when his wife is better @/@ when they 've sorted out finances - just waiting for the right time to tell her " blah , blah blah , blah !

If you have any integrety , you would walk away now .

He 's having his cake and eating it at the moment ?

Why would he want to give that up ?

I 'm struggling for ideas as to what to do for my birthday this week .

DH will be at work , DS at school and DD at nursery till 12 pm unless i choose to take her out for the day so i can go somwhere till 3.15pm .

In some ways i envy my DH who has a July birthday that generally falls within schools holidays and we are all around him with good weather .

This year I 've thougth and thought about what I can do either on my own or maybe with my almost 4 year old .

My Mum suggested I go over with her to visit my dad who 's on a house sit and have a sandwich with them at lunchtime and open my pressie .

This seems to be my best option but its not what i would choose to do or really want to do .

My parents have chosen to do this house sit , i really dont mind but i 'm not sure i want to go over , walk the dog and sit in a strangers house for a couple of hours to pass the time .

Any thoughts please on what you grown ups do for January birthdays when the weather is rubbish and your friends are working .

I dont expect to be entertained and happy to potter around or go to a National Trust/Swimming , but my local pool doens't have an open swim on thurs suitable for my availability and i do n't have a car free to drive .

Chalk it up to one those things that happens when you have kids and do something at the weekend instead .

( ETA : had I had the money , I would have gone off for a couple of hours and a coffee at the nicest garden centre near to where I live so I could get there by bus )

go for a meal with your DH in the evening after his work , and get your parents to babysit ?

day time wise - how much money do you want to spend ?

Get your nails @/@ hair etc done ?

i dont normally do anything in the day time for my bday ,

I 'm trying to muster some sympathy for you but I 'm sorry I really can n't .

My birthday is in January too , and most year I have to work . For the whole day ! !!!

This year , I worked all day , could n't celebrate with my dd because she was working in the evening , so I went out for a bite to eat with a couple of friends and then on to see a film .

I 'll celebrate my birthday with my dd when we both have some time together... in February .

Your parents want to see you and spend some time with you , give you a present so be gracious ( and a bit mature ) and go !

hi , i am getting married on february 18 th 2012 and i am planning on buying a gift for my wife to be .

She loves tiffany and i bought her the chunky link bracelet with heart in the first few months that we were together so now i am thinking to get her the necklace .

Is the official tiffany Uk website the only place to buy official and not fake items or are there other places that sell tiffany ?

looked at links of london and pandora but I 'm not sure....

The only place to get Tiffany cheaper is the airport shops abroad , if the exchange rate/ duty free combination works in your favour .

If she likes charms you could get the Links sweetie bracelet - then you have the next few presents sorted out for the charms .

OH came home from work on Monday evening by taxi and found 3 men trying to break into the house .

They set upon him , knocked him to the floor and kicked him several times in head and stomach , stole his mobile phone and bag and ran off .

The police came out very quickly , did a drive around with OH and the cabby but did n't see them that night .

They took DH 's bag ( which they found dumped a few streets away ) and said they would forensically test it , and there was a CCTV camera which covered the area and the cabby said he could definitely identify the men as he got a clear view .

DH has not been asked to give a statement , and we assume nor has the cabby .

He got a letter in the post this morning , dated Tuesday , saying the police were closing their investigation .

The detective in charge has n't answered phone calls and his bag has n't been returned to him , which contained business papers and clothes .

It seems pretty clear that the police did not bother with forensic testing and may not even have checked the CCTV footage .

Is there anything which can be done to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempted burglary and common assault , where there are witnesses to the attack ?

If it is relevant at all , DH has no previous convictions , arrests or anything similar with the police , and is a middle aged businessman set upon by 20 year old males of a different racial background to us .

They can n't just ' close an investigation ' the day afterwards , not having even taken statements .

I 'd say get some legal advice , or write to the Police , stating what you 've put in your post above and ask for an explanation .

you could try posting this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationships board ?

I would get down to the police station sooner than just writing a letter .

If CCTV needs to be examined and has not yet been looked at , you want it seized asap , before it is recorded over .

It is of course possible that the CCTV was n't working on the day in question but I am still surprised no other forensic examinations have taken place .

BUT ! Be prepared to be stopped for motoring offences by disgruntled coppers for the next 10 or so years........

The police are trying to fiddle the figures .

Ask for the crime number and see .

I think as with everything from reading this thread there 's always the politics and the ooo could you just do a bit more for us aspect , we 'll have to keep our mouths firmly zipped .

I 'm looking to trying to start volunteering sometime in the near future and was a rainbow/brownie/guide when younger and think i might enjoy helping out but have no idea how to make the first steps to get involved

Hi All I am looking for advice please .

DD1 is in futher education -

because the course she wanted to do is n't available near us she is in residential college and we pay her accommodation and food costs ,

it leaves things very tight , but as we felt this was a great opportunity for her we were prepared to do it .

She also has the use of a car as its easier ( and a lot cheaper ) than us driving her back and forth most weeks .

DD2 is due to leave school next summer and is hoping to start a hairdressing apprenticeship .

She started to talk about driving lessons ( a bit premature I know ) and us buying a car and paying for petrol and insurance .

I mentioned to her that as she will be earning an income it will be time for her to start paying us towards her keep , etc.

She thinks that will be very unfair as we are still paying for her older sister .

Any suggestions please - we are prepared to take the money and put it away for her future ( although I would n't admit that to her as she would want it sooner rather than later ) .

I do see her point , but am not prepared to let her get away with not paying anything .

Thanks for reading .

If she does n't , then you could speak to them both about the contributions you expect from them when they both start earning .

It seems unfair to not pay for DD2s if you did , and then to allow access to the car .

I do n't see why she would expect her own car if her sister shares yours , although you will have to think about priorities for who needs the car and what you will do if both want the car !

Letting her get away without paying anything won't teach her anything for the future , but equally if she does't get the same treatment as her sister she 'll probably feel quite upset .

she has to work part @-@ time in a salon but does n't earn very much and the stuff she has had to buy @/@ keep replacing for the course has been very expensive.. so my daughter has had to help her by not actually taking any keep money as long as she is on the course..

its meant my grandaughter has managed to pay for all her own clothes , fares , lunches , and going out money over the course..

my daughter was happy that she 'd found something she wanted to do and was able to near enough support herself through it..

as I said at the beginning as an apprentice she will be earning peanuts..

To support DD1 to the tune that you are and then to expect DD2 to pay into the household on what I 'm sure will be a much less than minimum wage apprenticeship seems like a double blow to DD2 to me ! and I can appreciate her frustration .

I do think that whilst DD2 is doing her apprenticeship she should be allowed to retain her wages .

You should explain to her that this is your way of ensuring that they are both treated equally in what are very different circumstances .

However I would also make clear that once either of them begin to earn a full time wage outside of college or apprenticeship that they will be expected to contribute to the house if they continue to live there !

I 'm sorry but I can see your DD2 's point -

you say you would support her if she went to college but even though you agree that the apprenticeship would be a better career choice you 're prepared to penalise her for it .

If she was leaving school to get a normal job I would agree she should contribute but this is basically her still studying , just going about it in a slightly less conventional way .

Has she arranged to apply for this herself ?

That to me shows a lot of intitative and motivation for someone her age ,

rather then taking the more mainstream option of college she has looked into her options and gone for what will be best for her future career .

Apprentice wages are extremely low so while she is on those could you maybe look at a compromise -

eg you will still provide her room and board ( the same as you are doing for her sister ) but she has to pay all her expenses out of her wage , ie her travel to work , lunches there if she needs them , phone if she has it , any expenses she needs for work .

Normally I would say yes , take a nominal amount from your DD2 as she is now " working ", but as you are supporting DD1 , I can see why she might be cheesed off .

I guess it depends on how much she is earning during her first year as an apprentice......

that 's still a lot of money for a school leaver who has no household expenses or food to pay .

Personally I would take a small amount , say £20 a week from her and , as you said , put it in a savings account for if she does decide to go travelling in the future .

Explain to here that it may not seem fair , but she is now earning , and the cost of this compared to living away from home , is minimal . Or show her a breakdown of what a 1 @/@ 3 of all household cost would be .

Of course it is easier for her to get home at weekends , but can she not get the train / bus ?

When I was at uni , I think I could count the number of students who lived away from home and had a car on one hand - the rest mnade do with a young persons railcard .

If the answer if no , neither of them really need it then I would suggest that they share the car ( 1 month on / off , for example ) .

A car for a teenager / student , is an expensive luxury and with the rising costs of insurance and fuel , most parents cannot this for one child , let alone 2 .
