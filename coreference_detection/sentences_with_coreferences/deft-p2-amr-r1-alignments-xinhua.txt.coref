The Chinese branch of the American Chamber of Commerce recently dispatched a delegation made up of twenty - five people launching a month - long lobbying campaign in Washington directed at congress and the White House , asking them to continue to extend granting China most - favored - nation trading status .

The Chamber of Commerce delegates participating in this lobbying campaign come from many well - known in Washington , large American companies , such as Dow Jones , AT&T , IBM , Boeing , McDonald Douglas , General Electric , Westinghouse , Ford , and the Xian Ni Lei De Group , etc .

They split into five groups and altogether visited about 150 members of congress , congressional aides , and government officials , using their experience of investing in and managing enterprises in China to explain the necessity of extending giving China most - favored - nation trading status .

With the once - a - year deliberations by the American administration and congress concerning the question of China 's most - favored - nation trading status again approaching , American businesses in Washington are universally concerned that the disputes among America 's political parties in this big election year could make this question even more complicated , hence the organization of groups to carry out a lobbying campaign directed at them that is organized and is planned .

Zhen Wang , a businessman of Chinese descent who is representing the Guangzhou chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce and the Xian Ni Lei De Group and is participating in the lobbying team , said to this reporter that , as a follow - up action to this lobbying effort , he prepared to mobilize tens of thousands of distributors who belong to the company to write to their local congressional representatives to support extending China 's most - favored - nation trading status .

The head of the Guangdong branch of the American Chamber of Commerce , the attorney Yonghua Kang , said the Clinton administration had already demonstrated that it wanted to extend China 's most - favored - nation trading status and because of this , the focus of this round of lobbying was those members of congress who are more conservative .

Xinhua News Agency , Tianjin , December 25 th , by reporters Jianchang Li and intern Suhong Ge

Tianjin , the largest coastal city in northern China , while attracting foreign merchant investment , also encourages enterprises to invest and build factories overseas .

According to reports from the Committee of Foreign Economy and Trade of Tianjin , these more than 300 overseas enterprises are involved in industries such as import and export trade , production and processing , medical treatment and health , tourism , catering , engineering contracts , etc. , and are spread over more than sixty countries and regions .

The " Medicinal Diet " established in Singapore by Tianjin attracts the attention of local political figures .

It is reported that next year the Committee of Foreign Economy and Trade of Tianjin will continue to adopt measures to organize and guide a number of enterprises overseas to invest and build factories .

Currently , this city has already established a relevant database to provide investment partners and projects through Chinese embassies and institutions in foreign countries , and foreign embassies and institutions in China .

On the occasion of the 30 th anniversary of the establishment of ASEAN , the heads of the nine ASEAN countries and the heads of China , Japan and South Korea held an informal meeting in Kuala Lumpur , capital of Malaysia , on the 15 th .

After the end of the cold war , ASEAN confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast Asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .

ASEAN , with China , Japan and South Korea , strengthened their cooperation and jointly planned development , becoming a force that holds the balance .

Therefore , the holding of the informal meeting of heads of the countries in eastern Asia possesses important significance in promoting cooperation between all countries , in safeguarding regional and global security , and in accelerating the development towards world multi @-@ polarization .

The development of countries can not be separated from the region , and that of the region can not be separated from the globe .

Discarding old concepts and establishing new international political and economic orders conforms with the main trend of the times in which people of all countries demand peace , request development , seek stability and promote cooperation .

To correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east Asian economic cooperation in the 21 st century and forecasting the future development of eastern Asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern Asia .

Without a peaceful environment , any construction undertaking would be impossible to discuss .

To establish relations between countries on the basis of the five principles , namely mutual respect of sovereignty and integrity of territory , non @-@ aggression , non @-@ interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , is the political basis and precondition for global and regional security .

That all countries strengthen their mutual benefits and cooperation in the field of economy , open up to each other , eliminate inequalities and discriminatory policies in economic and trade transactions , gradually narrow the development gaps between countries and strive for joint prosperity is the economic basis for global and regional security .

That all countries promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and cooperation , and promise to settle disputes and conflicts between countries in peaceful ways is a realistic way to ensure peace and security .

This year some countries in eastern Asia encountered financial turmoil and have had some difficulties in their economic development , but the economic basis of east Asian countries is still good and advantageous factors for economic development still exist .

It is believed that after reviewing experience and implementing proper adjustments , the economy of eastern Asia will definitely continue to move forward in development .

But in order to safeguard fundamental benefits to the people of all east Asian countries , and to promote the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind , we must progressively strengthen the east Asian cooperation .

He emphatically pointed out that " We should uphold the principles of mutual respect , equal participation , mutual benefit , and co @-@ development ; we should strengthen cooperation in economy and technology , especially in the field of new high level technology , and establish reasonable regional economic structures , and form a mode of economic cooperation on the basis of learning from others ' strengths and offsetting others ' weaknesses , and mutual benefiting from advantages , balancing interests , and practicing non @-@ exclusiveness and non @-@ discrimination ; and we should strengthen trust , broaden common understanding , seek common points while maintaining differences , and resolve disputes appropriately through friendly dialogue and consultation to guarantee the region 's peace and stability . "

With this good start , people have good reason to believe that the coordination and cooperation between east Asian countries will certainly show more hopeful prospects in the near future .

A few days ago , the National Planning Commission , the National Economic and Trade Commission and the National Development Bank considered and approved the technical transformation project of Chongqing 's Chang'an Auto Stock Co. , Ltd. to a production capacity of 150,000 Chang'an Auto luxury cars .

Recently , when talking about Hong Kong 's prospects and the Taiwan issue , Qichen Qian , vice premier of State Council and minister of foreign affairs , said that the central government was always fully confident of Hong Kong 's prospects .

At the same time , he hoped that Taiwan authorities would follow the trends of historical development and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for the political negotiations between both sides of the Taiwan Straits .

Qichen Qian made the above comments while he talked about international situations and China 's foreign affairs of 1997 at an interview with a reporter from the People 's Daily .

Qichen Qian said that in the nearly half year since the return of Hong Kong everything was done in an orderly fashion by the special administrative region 's government , and that the guidelines of " one country , two systems " , " administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people " and " a high degree of autonomy " were implemented effectively .

The central government and the people of the whole country always gave strong backing to the special region 's government and the compatriots of Hong Kong .

We believed that Hong Kong could continue to maintain its position as a free port and a center of international finance , trade and shipping , and to keep its long - term prosperity and stability .

Qichen Qian also made a comment on the fact that beginning this year , the Taiwan authorities continued to practice the so - called " practical diplomacy " , advocated that Taiwan was a so - called " independent sovereign state " , and actively set up obstacles in the negotiations between both sides of the straits .

He said that accomplishing the complete unification of the motherland was the common wish of all the Chinese people throughout the country and abroad .

Since Hong Kong 's return to the motherland , relations between both sides of the straits has drawn greater attention .

We hope Taiwanese authorities conform to the historical development trends , and take opportunities to make active responses and wise choices for political negotiations between both sides of the Straits .

The statistics from China 's Customs Bureau show that , by November of 1997 , the total volume of imports and exports between Hong Kong and the inland was 45.085 billion US dollars , accounting for 15.7 % of the total volume of imports and exports of the inland , increasing 27 % over the same period last year ; among which exports to Hong Kong by the inland were 38.913 billion US dollars , increasing 36.2 % over the same period last year ; and imports from Hong Kong by the inland were 6.172 billion US dollars , decreasing 10.7 % over the same period last year .

Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation officials in charge of the economic and trade exchange with Hong Kong said that , the growth rate of imports and exports and the growth rate of exports to Hong Kong by the inland was far higher than the growth rate of imports and exports and the growth rate of exports of the inland ( at a rate of 14 % and 23.2 % ) over the same period , and is one of the inland regions with the fastest export growth .

From January to September of last year , the inland absorbed 6,165 projects directly invested by Hong Kong , accounting for 40.99 % of the country 's total number over the same period , and the agreed value of Hong Kong capital was 11.711 billion US dollars , accounting for 33.8 % of the country 's total investment over the same period and the actual value of utilizing Hong Kong capital was 15.418 billion US dollars , accounting for 48.93 % of the country 's total value over the same period .

From January to November of last year , the inland signed 1,474 new contracts for foreign contracted projects and cooperation of labor service and design consultation in Hong Kong , with a contracted value of 2.094 billion US dollars , a completed turnover of 1.58 billion US dollars and 21,153 man - times of labor service sent to Hong Kong .

The Bank of China , the largest foreign exchange bank in China , had good business performance in 1997 , and realized a profit of 6.033 billion yuan for the whole year , of which domestic banks realized a profit of 2.428 billion yuan .

The Bank of China actively and steadily promoted various operation systems reforms such as the credit management system , the auditing system and the personnel management system , etc. in 1997 , and also performed exploration in the area of establishing market operating mechanisms .

Regarding operations , this bank strengthened deposit work , made RMB deposit growth rate come back , at the same time , through methods such as signing bank - enterprise cooperation agreements and strengthening services to major clients , etc. , developed potential high grade clients .

According to statistics , the balance of deposits in RMB of Bank of China reached 591.239 billion yuan last year , the balance of loans for all items in RMB reached 564.452 billion yuan ; the balance of deposits for foreign currency was 35.508 billion US dollars and the balance of loans for all items with cash foreign exchange was 39.787 billion US dollars .

At the same time , the Bank of China has also paid attention to bringing all advantages into full play , actively developing the work of marketing ; making the traditional business of international settlement continue to maintain an advantageous position in furious market competition ; and also gained the new development of intermediate services such as foreign exchange settlement and sales , credit cards , agents , substitute charges , etc .

It was learned that the amount of foreign exchange settlement and sales of the bank respectively reached 91.07 billion US dollars and 47.1 billion US dollars last year ; the amount of business of international trade settlement was 139.857 billion US dollars for the whole year .

According to the latest statistics data published by Finland Customs , in 1997 , Finland 's exports to Southeast Asia grew by 28 % .

Up till October of last year , Finland 's export volume to major trading partners , such as Hong Kong , China , Indonesia , Thailand , Singapore , Malaysia etc. , reached 10.7 billion Finland Marks ( 1 Finland Mark approximates 0.19 US dollar ) , which was equivalent to gross exports of the whole year of 1996 .

The proportion of Finland 's exports to this region in its total exports increased from 1 % ten years ago to 6.2 % .

Finland Customs estimated that , the financial crisis in Southeast Asia may weaken Finland 's exports to this region , in particular , the export of electromechanical products would be impacted .

The growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the State Planning Commission , the Statistical Bureau and the China Academy of Social Sciences , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .

The key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the second half year of 1993 obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .

Actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro @-@ economic situation tends to loosen , China 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .

This year , China plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .

Fixed assets investments will grow by 10 % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by 10 % and export growth by 8 % .

After bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .

Hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .

Along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized State owned enterprises , the pace of State owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by 20 % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized State owned enterprises will gradually form .

However , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .

China has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within 3.5 % through implementation of a large scale " re @-@ employment " project .

According to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .

Currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of China 's economy has reached 42 % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .

People in economic circles said that China should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .

Forecasting the Year of the Tiger , although China 's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

Statistic figures show that , from January to November in 1997 , the number and contract sum of recently approved foreign investment projects decreased by 15.39 % and 33.52 % respectively over the same period last year , the amount of average foreign investment per project decreased 21.33 % over the same period last year , and the proportion of industrial projects in recently approved projects also decreased by 5.4 % .

Since reform and opening up to the outside world , China has been promoting attracting foreign investment even more as an important part of the basic national policy of opening up , the past five years have been five years when foreign merchants ' investments grew fastest , and foreign investments have stepped into the majority of fields of China 's national economy .

The amount of foreign investment actually utilized by China has been increasing in successive years , creating an historical high in 1997 , and a number of projects with particularly intensified technologies and funds have appeared .

On the other hand , since 1994 and 1995 , the number of recently approved foreign investment projects and the contract sum has been continually decreasing , which will directly affect China 's foreign investment attraction growth rate in the period to come .

However , at the beginning of this year , concerned parties announced that , for projects that had foreign invested , and which were in fields encouraged by China such as the new , high technology industry , infrastructure , etc. , the country would implement certain preferential taxation policies .

In order to perfect the management of international commercial loans , the National Foreign Exchange Bureau decided to implement a new method of managing international commercial loans borrowed by domestic institutions from January 1 st this year .

According to regulations by the National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau , international commercial loans indicate loans raised and borrowed by domestic institutions from financial institutions , enterprises , individual or other economic organizations abroad , and from foreign - funded financial institutions within China 's border , whose contractual repayment obligations are in foreign currency .

Export credits , international financing leaseholds , compensation trades with foreign exchange repayment methods , overseas institution 's and individual 's foreign exchange deposits ( excluding foreign exchange deposits in banks approved for offshore operations ) , project financing , financing under trade projects over 90 days and other forms of foreign exchange loans will all be treated and managed as international commercial loans .

According to regulations , the People 's Bank of China is the approving authority for international commercial loans borrowed by domestic institutions , the People 's Bank of China has authorized the National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau to be specifically responsible for the approval , supervision and management of commercial loans by domestic institutions .

International business loans that have not been approved but were signed on their own authority will not be valid , the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau will not process the registration of foreign debts , banks are not allowed to open exclusive foreign debt accounts for them , loan principals and interests are not to be remitted out on their own authority .

The National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau clearly stipulated in the new method that , domestic institutions borrowing international commercial loans externally are only limited to : China - capital financial institutions approved by the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau to operate foreign exchange loan business ; juridical people of non @-@ financial corporations approved by the State Department 's Authorization Department .

Juridical people of non @-@ financial institutions who borrow international commercial loans directly must possess these several conditions , that is , have continual profits for the last three years , have import and export business permission , belong to a national encouraged industry ; possess a complete financial management system ; must have a ratio of net assets to total assets not lower than 15 % for juridical people of trade - type non @-@ financial corporations , must have ratios of net assets to total assets not lower than 30 % for juridical people of non trade - type non @-@ financial corporations ; must have a total sum of international business loans borrowed and foreign guarantee surpluses not exceeding 50 % of net asset 's equivalent foreign exchange worth ; must have total of foreign exchange loan and foreign exchange guarantee surplus not exceeding the amount of exchange created in the previous year .

Kazuo Nakamura , at a public lecture jointly organized by Beijing 's Wu Jia Economic Consulting Company , Ltd. and Japan 's Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank , made a report concerning the new year 's world economic and financial situation .

After he reviewed the world economic and financial situation of ' 97 , he said that due to the economic growth in Asia , including Japan , further slowing down , the economic growth of America , even though its current economic activity is relatively good , and of other countries will also feel a very large effect .

Compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .

But , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .

Nakamura said that the Japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year ' 97 , and that in ' 98 , if it did n't adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .

He said further that China 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of Japan and Asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .

But because China 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over 100 billion US dollars in foreign exchange reserves , it is n't likely to sink into the crisis like the other Asian nations .

Professor Yuyi Liu said that he picked up the stone on the road to a yuhua stone processing plant in a suburb of Nanjing five years ago , and after he returned home he carefully inspected the stone and discovered the " territory of China " on it .

At the international meeting on aiding Palestinian autonomy which was held in Washington on October 1 st of last year , donor countries pledged to provide 2.4 billion US dollars of development aid within 5 years , of which 750 million US dollars would be appropriated in the first year .

Premier Peng Li delivered a written speech to welcome the International Population and Development Congress .

He thinks that the Chinese government 's guidelines of planning , strategizing and implementation of the population problem and socioeconomic problems as one is correct , effective in its implementation , and successful .

Peng Li said that in the beginning of September of this year , the United Nations would hold the International Population and Development Congress in Cairo with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .

This shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .

He feels that this Congress has important meaning , and the Chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the Congress .

The Chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .

In light of China 's basic national condition , the Chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits China 's actual needs .

At the same time , the Chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .

Presently , the Chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .

This is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .

He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .

Because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , China will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .

The Chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of China 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the Chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .

For this , the Chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co @-@ operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !
