a(S'According to the international reports on January 11 , eBay announced that it will acquire online ticket website StubHub for 310 million US dollars in cash to further expand its influence on electronic commerce .'
p5
I1
tp6
a(S'More than six years ago , Jeff Fluhr and Stanford School of Business graduate Eric Baker founded StubHub with Fluhr as its chief executive officer .'
p7
I3
tp8
a(S'Fluhr said in a statement : " StubHub \'s business model is an excellent fit with eBay , and we have admired eBay for a long time . "'
p9
I2
tp10
a(S"Over the past two years , as investors were concerned about the slowdown in eBay 's online auction business , its poor management , slow business expansion , and other factors , its market value has been dwindling ."
p11
I1
tp12
a(S'In 2006 its ticket sales was 400 million US dollars with annual profits reaching 100 million US dollars .'
p13
I2
tp14
a(S'Ticket sellers selling tickets on this website must pay a 15 percent fee , while buyers also have to pay a 10 percent commission to StubHub .'
p15
I2
tp16
a(S'I remember my first year studying at Qinghua , I went to my first elective course called " Inspirations in the History of Physics . "'
p17
I1
tp18
a(S'The teacher was very erudite , his lectures were very lively ; he summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time I was enthralled .'
p19
I1
tp20
a(S'In all my five years at the university , I never had another course that interesting .'
p21
I1
tp22
a(S'If I were to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discoveries in physics all had their own necessity and theoretical basis ( for example , the development of mathematics ) .'
p23
I1
tp24
a(S'One day I wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets ( dried tofu in the Northeast ) .'
p25
I1
tp26
a(S'So I normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .'
p27
I2
tp28
a(S'Because that day I needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , I set the timer and told my wife to turn off the heat when it was done .'
p29
I3
tp30
a(S'My wife is very lazy , and when the timer sounded , she turned off the heat and left the pot sitting on the stove .'
p31
I1
tp32
a(S'When I came back and looked , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .'

a(S"Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Your uncle is just your uncle ."
p35
I2
tp36
a(S'This morning I went to the supermarket with Dad , and when it came time to check out I discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .'
p37
I2
tp38
a(S'Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .'
p39
I2
tp40
a(S'In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .'
p41
I1
tp42
a(S"In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories ( here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise ) ."
p43
I1
tp44
a(S'But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co @-@ workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .'
p45
I3
tp46
a(S"So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney ."
p47
I1
tp48
a(S'In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .'
p49
I1
tp50
a(S'Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it .'
p51
I2
tp52
a(S'If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .'
p53
I3
tp54
a(S'I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States .'
p55
I2
tp56
a(S"On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness ."
p57
I1
tp58
a(S"Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations ."
p59
I1
tp60
a(S"We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense ."
p61
I1
tp62
a(S"So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong ."
p63
I4
tp64
a(S'When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .'
p65

tp66
a(S'Well , gasoline in Richmond has has hit $ 3.00 a gallon , or just shy of it ,'

a(S"the most I 've ever paid for in my life ."
p71
I1
tp72
a(S'Others feel less constrained .'
p73
I1
tp74
a(S"( 1 ) If you confiscate Exxon Mobil 's profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc."
p75
I5
tp76
a(S'( 2 ) If you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .'
p77
I3
tp78
a(S"The Governor has said he will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ...."
p79
I4
tp80
a(S"( The Governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in Virginia 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination ."
p81
I1
tp82
a(S"Unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise $ 1 billion for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post ."
p83
I2
tp84
a(S'This shift is driven by the combination of ( a ) escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like China and India , and ( b ) the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .'
p85
I1
tp86
a(S'The American public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,'
p87
I1
tp88
a(S'and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .'
p89
I2
tp90
a(S'Here in Virginia , the General Assembly has been examining what Virginia can do to increase energy production .'
p91
I1
tp92
a(S'But there is nothing that Virginia can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .'
p93
I2
tp94
a(S'What the political and business leadership of Virginia has so far failed utterly to do is admit that Virginia is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .'
p95
I2
tp96
a(S'Virginians consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .'
p97
I2
tp98
a(S'Let us hope that Gov. Kaine , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of Virginia .'
p99
I1
tp100
a(S'Jim - You are right on the money about how capitalism works ,'
p101
I1
tp102
a(S'Why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from Virginia ?'
p103
I1
tp104
a(S'Rather than drilling for oil and gas off the Atlantic Coast , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .'
p105
I1
tp106
a(S'You can encourage R&D on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .'
p107
I1
tp108
a(S'AND , you can work to increase supply .'
p109
I1
tp110
a(S'They could double their capacity without leaving the premises .'

p115
I1
tp116
a(S"My office , home and children 's schools are all within a 6 mile radius ."
p117
I1
tp118
a(S'and you would keep some more of your money .'
p119
I1
tp120
a(S'Check out how much the Republican Senators want you to pay in other , new taxes too - to register your car , etc.'
p121

I3
tp130
a(S"Did n't she fight Robert Moses because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?"
p131
I2
tp132
a(S'Somehow I doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .'
p133
I1

a(S"There 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation ."
p135
I2
tp136
a(S'What you should NOT do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .'
p137
I2
tp138
a(S'In the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .'

I1
tp140

p141
I1
tp142

p143
I1
tp144
a(S'Once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world changes around them .'
p145
I3
tp146
a(S'I tend to agree with Jim that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .'
p147
I1
tp148
a(S'Toomanytaxes : Zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .'
p149
I1
tp150
a(S'Only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .'
p151
I2
tp152
a(S'Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .'
p153
I2
tp154
a(S'but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .'
p155
I2
tp156
a(S'It is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,'
p157
I1
tp158
a(S'Like you , Jim , I see the bright silver lining .'
p159
I2
tp160
a(S'I seem to be getting more questions whenever I pull up in my hybrid .'
p161
I1
tp162
a(S'Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .'
p163
I1
tp164
a(S'There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the Phoenix market .'
p165
I1
tp166

tp228
a(S"It 's hard to fault Arlington for pursuing its short - term self interest ."
p229
I1

Science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . The IPCC has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused .

tp17828
a(S"Now before you hotheads whose hobby is making pipe bombs in the garage write me angry letters ( or send me long round packages with no return address ) , I know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast .

a(S"In the field , US troops are a hard kill , especially because they move in armored convoys protected by choppers .

tp17846
a(S"Sometimes an insurgency has to learn its lessons several times . Take the case of pressure @-@ triggered IEDs . These are basically standard anti @-@ vehicle mines , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . People and cars can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( meaning armored ) vehicle rolls over that scale , the bomb goes off . ( Trucks are a problem . Some trucks weigh as much as an APC.) The best part is that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . You can all be off at the hookah parlor polishing up your alibis when it goes off ."

p17853
I1
tp17854
a(S"The M1 is a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgents have managed to knock out . As usual , the invasion was the easy part and the occupation was when things got lethal . We only lost 18 M1s in the conventional fighting , but the guerrillas have since managed to disable 80. Now most of those are track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action ."
p17855

tp17856
a(S"The good news is that the M1 has lived up to its rep for crew protection . The Army 's Armor Center says only five crew have died in IED attacks on M1s . ( Ten other M1 crew have been killed , mostly by sniper fire , riding in open hatches.)"
p17857
I3
tp17858
a(S"So if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal is to find a way to kill M1s . Not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . And that 's where the shaped @-@ charge IED comes in . Shaped charges were developed for tank killing , used in MBT anti @-@ armor rounds and antitank weapons . Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal . Metals with low melting points , usually copper . The bomb @-@ maker 's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible . So sometimes he 'll put several 155 mm shells beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of TNT under it ."
